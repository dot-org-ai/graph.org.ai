# Measure

Determining the size, quantity, extent, or magnitude of something using specific units, standards, or instruments.

## O*NET Context

Work activity focused on obtaining quantitative or qualitative data about objects, systems, or outcomes. Includes using instruments, conducting tests, evaluating metrics, and establishing standards to assess performance, quality, or progress.

## Semantic Forms

### Action (Base Form)
```typescript
await $.Product.measure({ dimensions: 'length-width-height', units: 'metric', precision: '0.1mm' })
```

### Predicate (Relationship)
```typescript
$.Inspector.measures.Quality
$.Analyst.measures.Performance
```

### Event (Past Tense)
```typescript
on($.Component.measured, async (event) => {
  await $.QualityReport.document({ componentId: event.id, measurements: event.data })
  if (event.withinSpecification) {
    await $.Batch.approve({ batchId: event.batchId })
  }
})
```

### Activity (Ongoing Process)
```typescript
const activeAssessment = $.Team.measuring.SystemPerformance
console.log(`Currently measuring: ${activeAssessment.metric} - Current value: ${activeAssessment.value}${activeAssessment.unit}`)
```

### Role (Actor)
```typescript
const measurer: $.Measurer = await $.findAgent({ expertise: 'quality-assurance', certification: 'ISO' })
measurer.conductTest(sample)
```

### Concept (Abstraction)
```typescript
const measurement: $.Measurement = {
  subjectId: object.id,
  metric: 'performance',
  value: 95.7,
  unit: 'percentage',
  standardDeviation: 2.3,
  timestamp: now(),
  instrument: 'precision-scale',
  verifiedBy: technician.id
}
```

### Inverse (Passive)
```typescript
const auditors = await db.related($.Process, $.measuredBy, $.QualityAssurance)
```
