# Simplify

Making something less complex, easier to understand, or more straightforward by removing unnecessary elements, reducing complications, or streamlining processes.

## O*NET Context

Work activity focused on reducing complexity, eliminating unnecessary steps or components, and making systems, processes, or information more accessible and manageable.

## Semantic Forms

### Action (Base Form)
```typescript
await $.Process.simplify({ complexity: 'high', goal: 'user-friendly', efficiency: 'optimize' })
```

### Predicate (Relationship)
```typescript
$.Developer.simplifies.Code
$.Designer.simplifies.Interface
$.Manager.simplifies.Workflow
```

### Event (Past Tense)
```typescript
on($.System.simplified, async (event) => {
  await $.Documentation.update({ changes: event.modifications })
  await $.Team.notify({ message: 'Process has been streamlined' })
})
```

### Activity (Ongoing Process)
```typescript
const activeSimplification = $.Engineer.simplifying.Architecture
console.log(`Currently streamlining: ${activeSimplification.scope}`)
```

### Role (Actor)
```typescript
const simplifier: $.Simplifier = await $.findAgent({ expertise: 'process-optimization' })
simplifier.streamlineOperations(complexSystem)
```

### Concept (Abstraction)
```typescript
const simplification: $.Simplification = {
  originalState: complexStructure,
  changesApplied: ['removed-redundancy', 'reduced-steps', 'improved-clarity'],
  improvements: { usability: '+40%', efficiency: '+30%' },
  timestamp: now()
}
```

### Inverse (Passive)
```typescript
const simplifyingAgents = await db.related($.Code, $.simplifiedBy, $.Developer)
```
