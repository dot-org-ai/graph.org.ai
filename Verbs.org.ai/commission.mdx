# Commission

Assigning a unique identity or serial number to an object, making it trackable within a system. Also refers to putting a system or equipment into active service.

## GS1 Context

Business step in supply chain where objects (particularly RFID-tagged items) are assigned unique identifiers (EPC codes, serial numbers, or asset tags) and registered into a tracking system. Critical for traceability and anti-counterfeiting.

## Semantic Forms

### Action (Base Form)
```typescript
await $.AssetTag.commission({
  serialNumber: generatedSerial,
  objectType: 'Item',
  owner: customerId,
  timestamp: now()
})
```

### Predicate (Relationship)
```typescript
$.System.commissions.Equipment
$.Registry.commissions.Assets
```

### Event (Past Tense)
```typescript
on($.Device.commissioned, async (event) => {
  await $.Registry.register({
    identifier: event.id,
    timestamp: event.timestamp
  })
  await $.Notification.send($.Owner)
})
```

### Activity (Ongoing Process)
```typescript
const production = $.Factory.commissioning.Units
console.log(`${production.unitsToday} units commissioned today`)
```

### Role (Actor)
```typescript
const commissioner: $.Commissioner = $.Admin({ permission: 'system_commissioning' })
commissioner.registerNewDevice(device)
```

### Concept (Abstraction)
```typescript
const commission: $.Commission = {
  identifier: uniqueId,
  objectId: object.id,
  timestamp: now(),
  commissioner: user.id,
  status: 'active',
  registryUrl: trackingSystemUrl
}
```

### Inverse (Passive)
```typescript
const assets = await db.related($.SerialNumber, $.commissionedBy, $.Factory)
```

- Commission equipment upon receipt and installation
