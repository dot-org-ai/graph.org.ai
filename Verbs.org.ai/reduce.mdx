# Reduce

Decreasing the size, amount, intensity, or complexity of something through systematic action, optimization, or elimination processes.

## O*NET Context

Work activity focused on minimizing waste, lowering costs, decreasing complexity, or diminishing the scope or scale of operations, processes, or resources to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

## Semantic Forms

### Action (Base Form)
```typescript
await $.Operations.reduce({
  target: 'carbon-emissions',
  percentage: 25,
  timeframe: '2-years'
})
```

### Predicate (Relationship)
```typescript
$.Company.reduces.Costs
$.Process.reduces.Complexity
```

### Event (Past Tense)
```typescript
on($.Emissions.reduced, async (event) => {
  await $.Reporting.generate({ metrics: event.data })
  await $.Stakeholder.notify({ achievement: event.percentReduction })
})
```

### Activity (Ongoing Process)
```typescript
const activeReduction = $.Team.reducing.OperationalCosts
console.log(`Cost reduction progress: ${activeReduction.percentSaved}%`)
```

### Role (Actor)
```typescript
const reducer: $.Reducer = await $.findAgent({
  expertise: 'process-optimization'
})
reducer.eliminateWaste(currentProcess)
```

### Concept (Abstraction)
```typescript
const reduction: $.Reduction = {
  initiativeId: initiative.id,
  baseline: originalValue,
  currentValue: newValue,
  percentChange: calculatePercent(),
  methodology: 'lean-six-sigma'
}
```

### Inverse (Passive)
```typescript
const optimizers = await db.related($.Cost, $.reducedBy, $.Analyst)
```

## Usage Examples

**Cost Optimization:**
- Reducing operating expenses through process improvement
- Decreasing procurement costs via supplier consolidation
- Minimizing waste in manufacturing processes
- Lowering energy consumption in facilities

**Complexity Management:**
- Reducing system complexity through architecture refactoring
- Simplifying workflow steps and eliminating redundancies
- Decreasing the number of manual approval steps
- Consolidating duplicate systems and platforms

**Resource Optimization:**
- Reducing headcount through automation
- Decreasing material usage in production
- Lowering inventory levels while maintaining service
- Minimizing environmental impact and emissions
