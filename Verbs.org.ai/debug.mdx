# Debug

Systematically identifying, analyzing, and resolving errors, defects, malfunctions, or anomalies in software code, hardware systems, or operational processes through testing and troubleshooting.

## O*NET Context

Work activity involving the diagnosis and correction of technical problems. Common in software development, IT support, manufacturing quality control, and systems administration roles.

## Semantic Forms

### Action (Base Form)
```typescript
await $.Application.debug({ breakpoints: true, logging: 'verbose', timeout: '5 min' })
```

### Predicate (Relationship)
```typescript
$.Developer.debugs.Code
$.Technician.debugs.Hardware
$.Engineer.debugs.System
```

### Event (Past Tense)
```typescript
on($.Issue.debugged, async (event) => {
  await $.Issue.resolve({ rootCause: event.cause, fix: event.solution })
  await $.Log.record({ debugger: event.engineer, timeSpent: event.duration })
})
```

### Activity (Ongoing Process)
```typescript
const troubleshooting = $.Application.debugging.Feature
console.log(`Debugging: ${troubleshooting.errors} issues, ${troubleshooting.progress}% resolved`)
```

### Role (Actor)
```typescript
const debugger: $.Debugger = await $.findAgent({ expertise: ['JavaScript', 'profiling tools', 'system tracing'] })
await debugger.resolveIssue(bug)
```

### Concept (Abstraction)
```typescript
const debugging: $.Debugging = {
  issueId: issue.id,
  startTime: now(),
  affectedSystems: ['api', 'database', 'cache'],
  rootCause: 'race condition in concurrent writes',
  severity: 'critical',
  resolution: 'implement mutex locking',
  testCases: ['concurrency-001', 'concurrency-002']
}
```

### Inverse (Passive)
```typescript
const issues = await db.related($.Application, $.debuggedBy, $.Developer)
```

## Usage Examples

**Software Development:**
- Developer debugs application crash in production
- QA engineer debugs test failures in CI pipeline
- Support engineer debugs customer-reported errors

**System Administration:**
- Administrator debugs network connectivity issues
- Technician debugs hardware malfunction symptoms
- DBA debugs database query performance problems

**Business Rules:**
- Debugging requires access to system logs and traces
- Root causes must be documented for prevention
- Fixes must be tested before deployment
- Critical issues require escalation protocols

## Related Verbs
- test - Examining systems for correct functioning
- analyze - Examining in detail for understanding
- troubleshoot - Solving operational problems
- fix - Correcting defects or problems
