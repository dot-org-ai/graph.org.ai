# Assemble

Combining components or parts into a finished product or higher-level unit.

## GS1 Context

Business step in manufacturing and production where individual components are combined according to specifications to create finished goods or sub-assemblies. Critical for inventory tracking and bill-of-materials (BOM) management.

## Semantic Forms

### Action (Base Form)
```typescript
await $.Product.assemble({
  components: [componentA, componentB, componentC],
  workOrder: woId,
  timestamp: now()
})
```

### Predicate (Relationship)
```typescript
$.Factory.assembles.Electronics
$.Robot.assembles.Subassemblies
```

### Event (Past Tense)
```typescript
on($.Unit.assembled, async (event) => {
  await $.Inventory.consume(event.bom)
  await $.QualityControl.schedule({ unit: event.unitId })
})
```

### Activity (Ongoing Process)
```typescript
const productionLine = $.Factory.assembling.Units
console.log(`Current output: ${productionLine.unitsPerHour}`)
```

### Role (Actor)
```typescript
const assembler: $.Assembler = $.Robot({ model: 'ABB-IRB-6700' })
assembler.startLine()
```

### Concept (Abstraction)
```typescript
const assembly: $.Assembly = {
  productId: product.id,
  components: bom,
  assemblyTime: duration,
  workOrder: wo.id,
  timestamp: now(),
  quality: 'passed'
}
```

### Inverse (Passive)
```typescript
const products = await db.related($.Component, $.assembledBy, $.Product)
```

## Usage Examples

**Manufacturing:**
- Robot assembles circuit boards on production line
- Worker assembles furniture from components
- Machine assembles engines from subassemblies
- Line assembles complete vehicles from modules

**Business Rules:**
- Assembly requires all BOM components to be in stock
- Assembly updates component inventory
- Assembly triggers next stage in production
- Assembly records create traceability trail

## Related Verbs
- disassemble - Breaking down into components
- create - Creating class-level instances
- stock - Placing components in storage
