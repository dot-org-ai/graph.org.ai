# Design

Creating plans, specifications, layouts, blueprints, or conceptual frameworks for new or modified products, systems, structures, services, or processes based on requirements and constraints.

## O*NET Context

Work activity involving the creation of specifications and plans that guide development, construction, or implementation. Common in engineering, architecture, product development, and UX/UI roles.

## Semantic Forms

### Action (Base Form)
```typescript
await $.Engineer.design({ system: 'manufacturing line', timeline: '3 months', constraints: ['budget', 'space', 'safety'] })
```

### Predicate (Relationship)
```typescript
$.Architect.designs.Building
$.Engineer.designs.Bridge
$.Designer.designs.Interface
```

### Event (Past Tense)
```typescript
on($.Project.designed, async (event) => {
  await $.Specification.finalize({ designer: event.creator, version: event.revision })
  await $.Review.schedule({ stakeholders: event.reviewers })
})
```

### Activity (Ongoing Process)
```typescript
const creation = $.Studio.designing.Campaign
console.log(`Designing: ${creation.concepts} concepts, ${creation.iterations} iterations`)
```

### Role (Actor)
```typescript
const designer: $.Designer = await $.findAgent({ skills: ['CAD', 'systems thinking', 'user-centered design'], portfolio: 'strong' })
await designer.createBlueprints(requirements)
```

### Concept (Abstraction)
```typescript
const design: $.Design = {
  projectId: project.id,
  designerId: designer.id,
  purpose: 'e-commerce platform',
  phases: ['research', 'wireframes', 'prototypes', 'specifications'],
  constraints: ['responsive', 'accessibility', 'performance'],
  deliverables: ['mockups', 'technical specs', 'design system'],
  tools: ['Figma', 'AutoCAD', 'Confluence'],
  status: 'in-review'
}
```

### Inverse (Passive)
```typescript
const blueprints = await db.related($.System, $.designedBy, $.Engineer)
```
