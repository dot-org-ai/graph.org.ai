# Optimize

Improving efficiency or performance by adjusting variables, removing inefficiencies, and finding the best possible solution.

## O*NET Context

Work activity focused on examining and improving the efficiency, effectiveness, or performance of processes, systems, or operations to achieve maximum results with minimum resources.

## Semantic Forms

### Action (Base Form)
```typescript
await $.Process.optimize({ metric: 'throughput', target: 'maximum' })
```

### Predicate (Relationship)
```typescript
$.Optimizer.optimizes.Workflow
$.Engineer.optimizes.Performance
```

### Event (Past Tense)
```typescript
on($.System.optimized, async (event) => {
  await $.Metrics.update({ improvement: event.gainPercent })
  await $.Team.celebrate({ achievement: 'efficiency-milestone' })
})
```

### Activity (Ongoing Process)
```typescript
const activeOptimization = $.Team.optimizing.QueryPerformance
console.log(`Currently optimizing: ${activeOptimization.aspect}`)
```

### Role (Actor)
```typescript
const optimizer: $.Optimizer = await $.findAgent({ expertise: 'performance-tuning' })
await optimizer.analyzeAndImprove({ system })
```

### Concept (Abstraction)
```typescript
const optimization: $.Optimization = {
  optimizerId: optimizer.id,
  targetId: subject.id,
  baselineMetrics: {},
  improvedMetrics: {},
  percentageGain: 0,
  costSavings: 0
}
```

### Inverse (Passive)
```typescript
const improvements = await db.related($.System, $.optimizedBy, $.Optimizer)
```
