# Refine

Improving the quality, clarity, precision, or effectiveness of something through iterative adjustment, purification, or systematic enhancement.

## O*NET Context

Work activity focused on optimizing processes, products, or approaches by making incremental improvements, removing impurities or inefficiencies, and perfecting details to achieve higher standards of quality or performance.

## Semantic Forms

### Action (Base Form)
```typescript
await $.DesignTeam.refine({
  designElement: prototype,
  focusArea: 'user-experience',
  iterations: 3
})
```

### Predicate (Relationship)
```typescript
$.Engineer.refines.Design
$.Analyst.refines.Process
```

### Event (Past Tense)
```typescript
on($.Product.refined, async (event) => {
  await $.Testing.initiate({ specifications: event.updated })
  await $.Team.notify({ improvement: event.changes })
})
```

### Activity (Ongoing Process)
```typescript
const activeRefinement = $.Developer.refining.Algorithm
console.log(`Current optimization level: ${activeRefinement.efficiency}%`)
```

### Role (Actor)
```typescript
const refiner: $.Refiner = await $.findAgent({
  expertise: 'quality-improvement'
})
refiner.enhanceProcess(currentWorkflow)
```

### Concept (Abstraction)
```typescript
const refinement: $.Refinement = {
  targetId: product.id,
  improvements: [],
  qualityMetrics: {},
  feedbackIncorporated: true,
  version: 'v2.1'
}
```

### Inverse (Passive)
```typescript
const improvedBy = await db.related($.Process, $.refinedBy, $.Consultant)
```
