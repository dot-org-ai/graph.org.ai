# Count

Performing a periodic inventory count, typically as part of cycle counting operations to verify stock levels and identify discrepancies.

## GS1 Context

Business step for conducting partial or full inventory counts to maintain accurate stock records. Cycle counting is a continuous counting process that checks inventory accuracy without requiring full warehouse shutdowns, as opposed to "take" which is comprehensive stock-taking.

## Semantic Forms

### Action (Base Form)
```typescript
await $.Inventory.count({
  location: aisle,
  timestamp: now(),
  verifiedBy: userId
})
```

### Predicate (Relationship)
```typescript
$.Warehouse.counts.Items
$.Auditor.counts.Stock
```

### Event (Past Tense)
```typescript
on($.Inventory.counted, async (event) => {
  const discrepancy = await $.System.compareRecords(event)
  if (discrepancy.variance > threshold) {
    await $.Audit.log(discrepancy)
  }
})
```

### Activity (Ongoing Process)
```typescript
const audit = $.Warehouse.counting.Inventory
console.log(`${audit.progressPercent}% counted, ${audit.itemsRemaining} to go`)
```

### Role (Actor)
```typescript
const counter: $.Counter = $.StockAuditor({ location: warehouse })
counter.verifySection(section)
```

### Concept (Abstraction)
```typescript
const count: $.Count = {
  inventoryId: inventory.id,
  countDate: now(),
  countedBy: user.id,
  methodology: 'cycle_count',
  items: [
    { sku: 'SKU001', physicalCount: 50, systemCount: 48 }
  ],
  variance: 2
}
```

### Inverse (Passive)
```typescript
const counts = await db.related($.Location, $.countedBy, $.Auditor)
```

## Usage Examples

**Inventory Management:**
- Warehouse staff count items in specific aisle
- Cycle counter verifies high-value SKUs weekly
- Auditor counts slow-moving inventory monthly
- Physical inventory count before financial close

**Business Rules:**
- Count requires witness or verification
- Count identifies variances against system
- Count initiates adjustment transactions
- Count frequency based on inventory category (ABC analysis)

**Frequency Strategies:**
- A Items: Weekly or bi-weekly counts
- B Items: Monthly counts
- C Items: Quarterly counts
- Spot counts for high-variance locations
