# Create

Creating a new class-level instance or bringing something into existence. The foundational operation for instantiating any entity in the system.

## GS1 Context

Business step marking the creation of a new trackable entity, such as an order, shipment, or inventory batch. This is the initiating action that begins most business processes in supply chain operations.

## Semantic Forms

### Action (Base Form)
```typescript
await $.Order.create({
  customerId: customer.id,
  items: lineItems,
  timestamp: now()
})
```

### Predicate (Relationship)
```typescript
$.System.creates.Orders
$.User.creates.Documents
```

### Event (Past Tense)
```typescript
on($.Order.created, async (event) => {
  await $.Notification.send({ recipient: event.customer })
  await $.Fulfillment.schedule(event.items)
})
```

### Activity (Ongoing Process)
```typescript
const production = $.Factory.creating.Units
console.log(`Creating at rate of ${production.unitsPerHour} units/hour`)
```

### Role (Actor)
```typescript
const creator: $.Creator = $.User({ role: 'order_creator' })
creator.submitNewOrder(orderData)
```

### Concept (Abstraction)
```typescript
const creation: $.Creation = {
  entityId: entity.id,
  entityType: 'Order',
  createdAt: now(),
  createdBy: user.id,
  createdFrom: sourceEntity,
  initialState: 'pending'
}
```

### Inverse (Passive)
```typescript
const orders = await db.related($.User, $.createdBy, $.Order)
```
