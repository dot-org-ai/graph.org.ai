# Load

Placing goods onto a transport vehicle for shipment or transfer.

## GS1 Context

Business step for formally loading goods onto trucks, containers, aircraft, or other transport vehicles. This is a critical operation in outbound logistics where inventory transitions from warehouse storage to active transportation.

## Semantic Forms

### Action (Base Form)
```typescript
await $.Shipment.load({ vehicle: truckId, timestamp: now(), manifest: manifestId })
```

### Predicate (Relationship)
```typescript
$.Warehouse.loads.Truck
$.Logistics.loads.Container
```

### Event (Past Tense)
```typescript
on($.Shipment.loaded, async (event) => {
  await $.Transport.schedule({ vehicleId: event.vehicle, departure: event.plannedTime })
  await $.Notification.send({ recipient: event.destination, template: 'shipment-loaded' })
})
```

### Activity (Ongoing Process)
```typescript
const dispatch = $.Dock.loading.OutboundShipments
console.log(`Currently loading: ${dispatch.count} pallets, ${dispatch.weight}kg`)
```

### Role (Actor)
```typescript
const loader: $.Loader = await $.findAgent({ location: 'dock-3', available: true })
await loader.arrangeShipment(manifest)
```

### Concept (Abstraction)
```typescript
const loading: $.Loading = {
  shipmentId: shipment.id,
  vehicleId: vehicle.id,
  timestamp: now(),
  loader: user.id,
  items: manifest.items,
  weight: calculateWeight(manifest)
}
```

### Inverse (Passive)
```typescript
const handlers = await db.related($.Container, $.loadedBy, $.WarehouseStaff)
```

## Usage Examples

- Loading packages onto delivery trucks
- Loading pallets onto shipping containers
- Loading cargo onto aircraft
- Cross-dock operations loading

**Business Rules:**
- Loading must follow manifest verification
- Vehicle capacity constraints must be respected
- Weight distribution must meet regulatory standards
