An towing vessel is a seagoing tug which can perform emergency towing operations. The emergency towage can avert the grounding and wrecking of the vessel and the associated oil spill. To generate and optimize designs a model is created which enables the rapid design of emergency towing vessel. A primary function of a platform supply vessel is to transport supplies to the oil platform and return other cargoes to shore. Cargo tanks for drilling mud, pulverized cement, diesel fuel, potable and non-potable water, and chemicals used in the drilling process comprise the bulk of the cargo spaces.
