**Segment**: [Transportation and Storage and Mail Services](../../Transportation and Storage and Mail Services.mdx)

Floatover installation is an effective installation method for topsides of offshore platforms. The floatover operation is very sensitive to the ocean environment conditions, and the motions of the topside are required to be strictly limited within a certain level.
