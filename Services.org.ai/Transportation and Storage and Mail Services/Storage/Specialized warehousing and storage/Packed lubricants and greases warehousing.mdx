Lubricants are packaged in many different forms to satisfy a wide variety of consumption rates and storage facilities, Ideally lubricants should be stored indoors, if possible where the environment can be better controlled. A clean dry environment kept at a stable, moderate temperature is best. Store lubricants near sources of heat or steam.
