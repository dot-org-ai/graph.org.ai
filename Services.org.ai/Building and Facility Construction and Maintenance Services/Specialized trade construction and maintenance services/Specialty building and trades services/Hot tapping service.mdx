Also known as pressure tapping, is the service to tap into a connection to existing piping or pressure vessel without the interruption of emptying that section of pipe or vessel. This means that a pipe or tank can continue to be in operation whilst maintenance or modifications are being done to it. The process is also used to drain off pressurized casing fluids
