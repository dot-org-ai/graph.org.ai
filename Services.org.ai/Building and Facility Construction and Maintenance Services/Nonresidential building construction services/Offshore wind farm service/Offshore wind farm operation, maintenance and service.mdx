Operation, maintenance and service (OMS) are the combined functions which, during the lifetime of the wind farm, support the ongoing operation of the wind turbines, the balance of the plant, and associated transmission assets. OMS activities formally start at the wind farm construction works completion date. The focus of these activities during the operational phase is to ensure safe operations, maintain the physical integrity of the wind farm assets, and optimize electricity generation.
