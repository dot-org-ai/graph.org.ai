# Heat treatment service

**UNSPSC Code**: 73181315
**Class**: [Heat treatment services](Heat treatment services.mdx)

Heat treating is the process by which a metal is heated or cooled in a tightly controlled environment to manipulate physical properties such as its malleability, durability, fabricability, hardness, and strength. Heat treating services perform thermal treatments to modify the properties of metals, metal alloys, and other materials. The process requires precise control over temperature, time, and cooling rate of the material. It can be used to change a material's hardness, homogeneity, and strength, among other properties.
