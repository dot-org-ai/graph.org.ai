All hoses should be visually, externally inspected prior to each use and thoroughly inspected with hydrostatic testing you fill up the hose with a medium, such as water, and take it to a pre-specified test pressure and hold it for a period of time. During this pressure phase the hose is monitored and inspected to make sure the hose can withstand the pressure.
