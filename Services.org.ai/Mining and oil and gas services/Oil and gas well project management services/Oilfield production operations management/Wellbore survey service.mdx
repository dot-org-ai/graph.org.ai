# Wellbore survey service

**UNSPSC Code**: 71161213
**Class**: [Oilfield production operations management](Oilfield production operations management.mdx)
**Family**: [Oil and gas well project management services](../Oil and gas well project management services.mdx)
**Segment**: [Mining and oil and gas services](../../Mining and oil and gas services.mdx)

In performing a wellbore survey, the gyro is pointed in a known direction prior to running in the well, so throughout the survey the spin axis attempts to hold its surface orientation. Note that a compass card is aligned with the horizontal spin axis of the gyro.
