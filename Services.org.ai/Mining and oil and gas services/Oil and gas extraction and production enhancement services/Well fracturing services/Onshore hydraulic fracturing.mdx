# Onshore hydraulic fracturing

**UNSPSC Code**: 71131021
**Class**: [Well fracturing services](Well fracturing services.mdx)
**Family**: [Oil and gas extraction and production enhancement services](../Oil and gas extraction and production enhancement services.mdx)
**Segment**: [Mining and oil and gas services](../../Mining and oil and gas services.mdx)

Hydraulic fracturing (Fraccing) is a method used to extract gas from onshore gas deposits such as coal seams, shales and tight gas (deposits surrounded by rock/sand). Western Australia has only shale and tight gas deposits. If not done correctly, the fraccing process has the potential to contaminate surface and underground drinking water sources.
