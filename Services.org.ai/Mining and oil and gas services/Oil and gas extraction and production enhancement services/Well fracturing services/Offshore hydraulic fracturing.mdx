**UNSPSC Code**: 71131020
**Class**: [Well fracturing services](Well fracturing services.mdx)
**Family**: [Oil and gas extraction and production enhancement services](../Oil and gas extraction and production enhancement services.mdx)

Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, blasts water and chemicals into the seafloor to fracture rock and release oil and gas. Acidizing injects hydrofluoric or hydrochloric acid to etch pathways in rock walls and release the fossil fuels.
