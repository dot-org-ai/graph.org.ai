**UNSPSC Code**: 71131202
**Class**: [Oilfield nitrogen services](Oilfield nitrogen services.mdx)
**Family**: [Oil and gas extraction and production enhancement services](../Oil and gas extraction and production enhancement services.mdx)

Nitrogen purging services are essential when the required nitrogen supply exceeds a plant's ability to maintain the high flow rate often required during shutdowns and other maintenance procedures. Nitrogen purging is highly effective for pipeline purges, product displacement, and process pipeline inert.
