# Mud drilling chemicals service

**UNSPSC Code**: 71122618
**Class**: [Well completion services](Well completion services.mdx)
**Family**: [Well drilling and construction services](../Well drilling and construction services.mdx)
**Segment**: [Mining and oil and gas services](../../Mining and oil and gas services.mdx)

A service for supply of oil and gas drilling fluids, drilling chemicals, drilling mud chemicals and work over completion chemicals. A typical water-based drilling mud contains a clay, usually bentonite, to give it enough viscosity to carry cutting chips to the surface, as well as a mineral such as barite (barium sulfate) to increase the weight of the column enough to stabilize the borehole.
