# Offshore underbalanced drilling services

A full service of engineering design, Air, Foam, Mist aerated simulations for formations, In underbalanced reservoir drilling emphasis is on protecting the formation, particularly in low-pressure, depleted reservoirs. Encouraging the reservoir to flow while it is being drilled avoids creation of wellbore buildup and its associated negative impact on well productivity and reservoir recovery. Services control the inflow of reservoir fluids into the wellbore while drill. This technique minimizes near-wellbore damage, increases well productivity, and reduces drilling problems such as differential sticking and low rates of penetration especially in mature fields and horizontal wells. Reservoir analysis techniques, fluid systems, and well engineering personnel, wellbore permeability and pressures and ultimately reach total depth.
