# Directional drilling turbine

**Family**: [Well drilling and construction services](../Well drilling and construction services.mdx)
**Segment**: [Mining and oil and gas services](../../Mining and oil and gas services.mdx)

By spinning the bit at a high RPM, drilling turbines help achieve high performance in hostile drilling environments. When coupled with diamond-impregnated bits or our proprietary PDC bits, turbines deliver extended run lengths to help reach TD in one run.
