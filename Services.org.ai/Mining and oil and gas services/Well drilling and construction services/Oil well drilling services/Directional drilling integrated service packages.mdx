Directional drilling is the practice of accessing an underground oil or gas reserve by drilling in a non-vertical direction. Directional drilling is also called directional boring. Directional drilling increases the efficiency of oil and gas extraction and can also lessen the environmental impact of drilling. Integrated Drilling Services is a new concept in which all services and equipment and even in some cases material procurement are integrated under one contract.
