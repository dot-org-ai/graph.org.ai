**UNSPSC Code**: 85370000
**Segment**: [Healthcare Services](Healthcare Services.mdx)

This classification denotes the group of activities that yields a diagnosis of Diseases of the Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue. Diseases of the Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue Puerperium is listed in The World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems or ICD-10 Under Chapter XIII. This chapter is assigned a Block of Codes Starting With M. Chapter XV Also Uses the following Sub Blocks of M Codes: M00-M25 Arthropathies;  M40-M54 Dorsopathies;  M60-M79 Soft Tissue disorders;  M80-M94 Osteopathies and Chondropathies;  M95-M99 Other disorders of the Musculoskeletal System and Connective tissue. This chapter also uses sub  blacks as follows: M00-M03 Infectious Arthropathies;  M05-M14 Inflammatory Polyarthropathies;  M15-M19 Arthrosis;  M20-M25 Other joint disorders;  M30-M36 Systemic connective tissue disorders;  M40-M43 Deforming dorsopathies; M45-M49 Spondylopathies;  M50-M54 Other dorsopathies;  M60-M63 Disorders of muscles;  M65-M68 Disorders of synovium and tendon;  M70-M79 Other Soft Tissue disorders;  M80-M85 Disorders of Bone Density and Structure;  M86-M90 Other Osteopathies;  M91-M94 Chondropathies; M95 Other acquired deformities of Musculoskeletal System and Connective Tissue;  M96 Postprocedural Musculoskeletal Disorders, not elsewhere classified;  M99 Biomechanical Lesions, not elsewhere classified. Chapter XVIII sub blocks use the following three digit categories: M00 Pyogenic arthritis; M01 Direct infections of joint in infectious and parasitic diseases classified elsewhere; M02 Reactive arthropathies; M03 Postinfective and reactive arthropathies in diseases classified elsewhere; M05 Seropositive rheumatoid arthritis; M06 Other rheumatoid arthritis; M07 Psoriatic and enteropathic arthropathies; M08 Juvenile arthritis; M09 Juvenile arthritis in diseases classified elsewhere; M10 Gout; M11 Other crystal arthropathies; M12 Other specific arthropathies; M13 Other arthritis; M14 Arthropathies in other diseases classified elsewhere; M15 Polyarthrosis; M16 Coxarthrosis or arthrosis of hip; M17 Gonarthrosis or arthrosis of knee; M18 Arthrosis of first carpometacarpal joint; M19 Other arthrosis; M20 Acquired deformities of fingers and toes; M21 Other acquired deformities of limbs; M22 Disorders of patella; M23 Internal derangement of knee; M24 Other specific joint derangements; M25 Other joint disorders, not elsewhere classified; M30 Polyarteritis nodosa and related conditions; M31 Other necrotizing vasculopathies; M32 Systemic lupus erythematosus; M33 Dermatopolymyositis; M34 Systemic sclerosis; M35 Other systemic involvement of connective tissue; M36 Systemic disorders of connective tissue in diseases classified elsewhere; M40 Kyphosis and lordosis; M41 Scoliosis; M42 Spinal osteochondrosis; M43 Other deforming dorsopathies; M45 Ankylosing spondylitis; M46 Other inflammatory spondylopathies; M47 Spondylosis; M48 Other spondylopathies; M49 Spondylopathies in diseases classified elsewhere; M50 Cervical disc disorders; M51 Other intervertebral disc disorders; M53 Other dorsopathies, not elsewhere classified; M54 Dorsalgia; M60 Myositis; M61 Calcification and ossification of muscle; M62 Other disorders of muscle; M63 Disorders of muscle in diseases classified elsewhere; M65 Synovitis and tenosynovitis; M66 Spontaneous rupture of synovium and tendon; M67 Other disorders of synovium and tendon; M68 Disorders of synovium and tendon in diseases classified elsewhere; M70 Soft tissue disorders related to use, overuse and pressure; M71 Other bursopathies; M72 Fibroblastic disorders; M73 Soft tissue disorders in diseases classified elsewhere; M75 Shoulder lesions; M76 Enthesopathies of lower limb, excluding foot; M77 Other enthesopathies; M79 Other soft tissue disorders, not elsewhere classified; M80 Osteoporosis with pathological fracture; M81 Osteoporosis without pathological fracture; M82 Osteoporosis in diseases classified elsewhere; M83 Adult
