This classification denotes the group of activities that yields a diagnosis of Isolated Proteinuria With Specified Morphological Lesion.  Isolated Proteinuria With Specified Morphological Lesion is listed In The World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems or Icd-10 as a Three Digit Category under code A00 Icd-10 Also Has The Following Isolated Proteinuria With Specified Morphological Lesion Children in its Four-Character Category: N060 or Isolated Proteinuria With Specified Morphological Lesion : Minor Glomerular Abnormality; N061 or Isolated Proteinuria With Specified Morphological Lesion : Focal and Segmental Glomerular Lesions; N062 or Isolated Proteinuria With Specified Morphological Lesion : Diffuse Membranous Glomerulonephritis; N063 or Isolated Proteinuria With Specified Morphological Lesion : Diffuse Mesangial Proliferative Glomerulonephritis; N064 or Isolated Proteinuria With Specified Morphological Lesion : Diffuse Endocapillary Proliferative Glomerulonephritis; N065 or Isolated Proteinuria With Specified Morphological Lesion : Diffuse Mesangiocapillary Glomerulonephritis; N066 or Isolated Proteinuria With Specified Morphological Lesion : Dense Deposit Disease; N067 or Isolated Proteinuria With Specified Morphological Lesion : Diffuse Crescentic Glomerulonephritis; N068 or Isolated Proteinuria With Specified Morphological Lesion : Other; N069 or Isolated Proteinuria With Specified Morphological Lesion : Unspecified ISOLATED PROTEINURIA WITH SPECIFIED MORPHOLOGICAL LESION is listed in the Centers For Medicare & Medicaid Services International Classification Of Diseases Clinical Modification (Tenth Revision) (Icd-10-CM) as a Three Digit Category under code N06. ICD-10-CM also has the following ISOLATED PROTEINURIA WITH SPECIFIED MORPHOLOGICAL LESION CHILDREN in its Four-Character or Five-Character Categories: (ISOLATED PROTEINURIA WITH MINOR GLOMERULAR ABNORMALITY N06.0), (ISOLATED PROTEIN W FOCAL and SEGMENTAL GLOMERULAR LESIONS N06.1), (ISOLATED PROTEINURIA W DIFFUSE MEMBRANOUS GLOMERULONEPHRITIS N06.2), (ISOLATED PROTEINURIA W DIFFUSE MESANGIAL PROLIF GLOMRLNEPH N06.3), (ISOLATED PROTEINURIA W DIFFUSE ENDOCAPLRY PROLIF GLOMRLNEPH N06.4), (ISOLATED PROTEINURIA W DIFFUSE MESANGIOCAPILLARY GLOMRLNEPH N06.5), (ISOLATED PROTEINURIA WITH DENSE DEPOSIT DISEASE N06.6), (ISOLATED PROTEINURIA W DIFFUSE CRESCENTIC GLOMERULONEPHRITIS N06.7), (ISOLATED PROTEINURIA WITH other MORPHOLOGIC LESION N06.8), (ISOLATED PROTEINURIA WITH UNSPECIFIED MORPHOLOGIC LESION N06.9).
