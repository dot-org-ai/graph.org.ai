There are two common methods that the United States uses to dispose of chemical warfare Involves destruction of chemical agents and related weapons. The primary method is incineration,[1] where liquid agents are burned in a furnace of temperatures over 2,000 °F (1,093 °C). For chemical agents in delivery vessels (i.e. Mortars, Bombs, Artillery shells, etc.), this is a multi-step process.  Depending on the type of agent to be destroyed,a second method involves neutralization.  Neutralization destroys the chemical agent by mixing it with hot water or hot water and sodium hydroxide.
