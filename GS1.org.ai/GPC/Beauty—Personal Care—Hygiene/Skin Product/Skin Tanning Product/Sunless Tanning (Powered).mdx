Includes any products that can be described/observed as a powered device specifically designed for artificial skin tanning, and typically intended to create a tanned appearance without the need for exposure to the sun. Includes powered devices such as sun beds and sun lamps which act by emitting ultraviolet light and stimulating the production of melanin in the skin, which turns the skin to a darker colour. Specifically excludes all non-powered sunless tanning products, including both topical (products which are applied to the skin) and oral applications and all body cosmetics such as bronzers which are applied to the surface of the skin to provide the illusion of a suntan. Excludes products such as non-powered Topical and Oral Sunless Tanning products, Body Cosmetics such as Bronzers and Face Cosmetics such as Tinted Foundations, Powders and Moisturisers.
