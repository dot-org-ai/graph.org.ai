Includes any products that can be described/observed as a non-powered topical preparation or device specifically designed for artificial skin tanning, and typically intended to create a tanned appearance without the need for exposure to the sun. Includes topical application products (such as creams or lotions) which "dye" the skin. These products often contain the active ingredient dihydroxyacetone (DHA), which reacts with skin's proteins (amino acids) in the outer layers of the skin to produce a browning effect. Specifically excludes all oral sunless tanning products, all powered devices used for artificial skin tanning such as sun beds and sun lamps, and all body cosmetics such as bronzers which are applied to the surface of the skin to provide the illusion of a suntan. Excludes products such as Oral Sunless Tanning products, powered devices for Sunless Skin Tanning, Body Cosmetics such as Bronzers and Face Cosmetics such as Tinted Foundations, Powders and Moisturisers.
