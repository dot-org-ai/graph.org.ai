Includes any products that can be described/observed as pure non-volatile oils used mainly to dilute essential oils for massage. Products such as essential oils are often too strong/concentrated to be used directly on the skin, and therefore base carrier oils are used. Includes products such as grey jojoba, carrier oil, and grape seed oil. Excludes products such as Essential Oils, all Massage Oils/Lotions and Oil Diffusers.
