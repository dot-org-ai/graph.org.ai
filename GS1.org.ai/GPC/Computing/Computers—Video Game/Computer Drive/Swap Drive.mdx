Includes any products that can be described/observed as a peripheral data storage device, which can enable a computer to process data and execute programs requiring a greater amount of storage than that which is available in the main memory. Once the main memory is full the excess data remains on the storage device but is exchanged with data on the main memory when the operating system requires the data in order to execute a specific program or function. Excludes products such as Hard Disc Drives, Floppy Disc Drives and peripheral devices not specifically designed for use with Computers.
