Includes any products that can be described/observed as an analogue device specifically designed to produce a permanent image of a person, location or event. Typically it is composed of a lens system contained within a lightproof box or compartment containing a light sensitive film that is positioned behind a shutter, so that when the shutter is opened/released an image is captured upon the film. The film is replaceable and can be exchanged for a new one once all the film has been exposed. Excludes products such as Digital Cameras or Disposable Cameras.
