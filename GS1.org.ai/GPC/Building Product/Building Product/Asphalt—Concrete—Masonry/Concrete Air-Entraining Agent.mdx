# concrete air-entraining agent

**GPC Brick Code**: 10003901
**Class**: [asphalt/concrete/masonry](Asphalt—Concrete—Masonry.mdx)
**Family**: [building product](../Building Product.mdx)
**Segment**: [building product](../../Building Product.mdx)

Includes any products that may be described/observed as an agent that entrains microscopic air bubbles in the concrete: when the hardened concrete freezes, the frozen water inside the concrete expands into these air bubbles instead of damaging the concrete. These products must be used whenever concrete is exposed to freezing and thawing, as well as to de-icing salts. Excludes concrete dyes and bonding agents.
