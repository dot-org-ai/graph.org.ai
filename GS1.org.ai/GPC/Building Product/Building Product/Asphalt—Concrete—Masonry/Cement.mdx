Includes any products that may be described/observed as a building material that is a powder made of a mixture of oxides of calcium, silicon and aluminium by heating limestone (as source of calcium) with clay or sand (as source of silicon) and grinding the product, with a source of sulphate (most commonly gypsum). The resulting powder, when mixed with water, will become a hydrated solid over time; used with water and sand or gravel to make concrete and mortar. Includes Portland cement and plastic cement to which a plasticising material (limestone or hydrated lime), as well as other materials has been added to reduce setting time and facilitate workability. Excludes products such as concrete and leveling mixes.
