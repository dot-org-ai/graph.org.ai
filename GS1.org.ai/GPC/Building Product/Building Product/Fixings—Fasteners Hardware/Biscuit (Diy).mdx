Includes any products that can be described/observed as a biscuit, typically used with a biscuit joiner powered tool. Biscuits are predominantly used in joining sheet goods such as plywood, particle board and medium-density fibreboard. They are sometimes used with solid wood, replacing mortise and tenon joints as they are easier to make and almost as strong. Biscuits are also used to align edges of work pieces, such as when forming a 90 degree angle between work pieces. The biscuit provides a quick means of getting a perfectly flush joint, while at the same time reinforcing the joint. Excludes Dowel Pins, biscuit joiners, nails, pins, screws or any other fixing or fastener hardware.
