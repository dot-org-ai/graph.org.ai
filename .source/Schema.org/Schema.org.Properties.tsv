Often but not necessarily each [[variableMeasured]] will have an explicit representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org, or other RDF vocabularies and "knowledge graphs". In that case the subproperty of [[variableMeasured]] called [[measuredProperty]] is applicable.      The [[measurementTechnique]] property helps when extra clarification is needed about how a [[measuredProperty]] was measured. This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but can often serve as a high level summary for dataset discovery.   For example, if [[variableMeasured]] is: molecule concentration, [[measurementTechnique]] could be: "mass spectrometry" or "nmr spectroscopy" or "colorimetry" or "immunofluorescence". If the [[variableMeasured]] is "depression rating", the [[measurementTechnique]] could be "Zung Scale" or "HAM-D" or "Beck Depression Inventory".   If there are several [[variableMeasured]] properties recorded for some given data object, use a [[PropertyValue]] for each [[variableMeasured]] and attach the corresponding [[measurementTechnique]].

If an exception is specified as a [[Date]] then any event that is scheduled for that 24 hour period should be       excluded from the schedule. This allows a whole day to be excluded from the schedule without having to itemise every scheduled event.			schema:Schedule	schema:DateTime,schema:Date

The numeric component should also have a [valid GS1 check digit](https://www.gs1.org/services/check-digit-calculator) and meet the other rules for valid GTINs.

(Unicode 'FULL STOP' (U+002E)) rather than ',' to indicate a decimal point. Avoid using these symbols as a readability separator.\n* Note that both [RDFa](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/#using-the-content-attribute) and Microdata syntax allow the use of a "content=" attribute for publishing simple machine-readable values alongside more human-friendly formatting.\n* Use values from 0123456789 (Unicode 'DIGIT ZERO' (U+0030) to 'DIGIT NINE' (U+0039)) rather than superficially similar Unicode symbols.       			schema:DonateAction,schema:Offer,schema:TradeAction,schema:PriceSpecification	schema:Text,schema:Number

In such cases, value is used to represent the incentive’s percentage, while maxValue represents a limit (if one exists) to that incentive. The unitCode should be 'P1' and the unitText should be '%', while valueReference should be used for holding the currency type. For example, "You can claim up to 30% of the total cost of installation, up to a maximum of $7,500" would be:</p>     {         "@type": "QuantitativeValue",         "value": 30,         "unitCode": "P1",         "unitText": "%",         “maxValue”: 7500,         “valueReference”: “USD”     } <p>[[UnitPriceSpecification]]: Use this for incentives that are based on amounts rather than price. For example, a net metering rebate that pays $10/kWh, up to $1,000:</p>     {         "@type": "UnitPriceSpecification",         "price": 10,         "priceCurrency": "USD",         "referenceQuantity": 1,         "unitCode": "DO3",         "unitText": "kw/h",         "maxPrice": 1000,         "description": "$10 / kwh up to $1000"     } <p>[[LoanOrCredit]]: Use for incentives that are loan based. For example, a loan of $4,000 - $50,000 with a repayment term of 10 years, interest free would look like:</p>     {         "@type": "LoanOrCredit",         "loanTerm": {                 "@type":"QuantitativeValue",                 "value":"10",                 "unitCode": "ANN"             },         "amount":[             {                 "@type": "QuantitativeValue",                 "Name":"fixed interest rate",                 "value":"0",             },         ],         "amount":[             {                 "@type": "MonetaryAmount",                 "Name":"min loan amount",                 "value":"4000",                 "currency":"CAD"             },             {                 "@type": "MonetaryAmount",                 "Name":"max loan amount",                 "value":"50000",                 "currency":"CAD"             }         ],     }  In summary: <ul><li>Use [[QuantitativeValue]] for absolute/percentage-based incentives applied on the price of a good/service.</li> <li>Use [[UnitPriceSpecification]] for incentives based on a per-unit basis (e.g. net metering).</li> <li>Use [[LoanOrCredit]] for loans/credits.</li> </ul>.			schema:FinancialIncentive	schema:UnitPriceSpecification,schema:QuantitativeValue,schema:LoanOrCredit

schema:speakable	schema:speakable	rdf:Property	speakable	Indicates sections of a Web page that are particularly 'speakable' in the sense of being highlighted as being especially appropriate for text-to-speech conversion. Other sections of a page may also be usefully spoken in particular circumstances; the 'speakable' property serves to indicate the parts most likely to be generally useful for speech.  The *speakable* property can be repeated an arbitrary number of times, with three kinds of possible 'content-locator' values:  1.) *id-value* URL references - uses *id-value* of an element in the page being annotated. The simplest use of *speakable* has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.  2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, e.g. via class attribute. Use the [[cssSelector]] property.  3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the [[xpath]] property.   For more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this we define a supporting type, [[SpeakableSpecification]]  which is defined to be a possible value of the *speakable* property.          			schema:WebPage,schema:Article	schema:URL,schema:SpeakableSpecification
