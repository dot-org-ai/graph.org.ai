# Animal tranquilizing dart

**UNSPSC Code**: 10131607
**Class**: [Animal containment](Animal containment.mdx)
**Family**: [Animal containment and habitats](../Animal containment and habitats.mdx)
**Segment**: [Live Plant and Animal Material and Accessories and Supplies](../../Live Plant and Animal Material and Accessories and Supplies.mdx)

Device fired from a tranquilizer gun or cross-bow or breath-powered blowgun to tranquilize a live animal.  It consists of a hypodermic needle tip filled with a dose of tranquilizer solution that is either sedative, comatosing or paralytic, which is injected into the target upon impact and will temporarily impair the target's physical function to a level that allows it to be approached and handled in an unresisting and thus safe manner.
