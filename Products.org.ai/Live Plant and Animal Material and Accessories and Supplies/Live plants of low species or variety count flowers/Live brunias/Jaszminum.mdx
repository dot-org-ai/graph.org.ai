Evergreen, deciduous or semi-deciduous shrub or climbing plants. The stems are quadrangular, green or greyish, profusely branched. Leaves arranged alternately or opposite; they can be trifoliate or odd-pinnate. The inflorescences are racemose, usually arising from the axils of the leaves. The flowers, commonly white –although there are some yellow and reddish species– are hermaphroditic. They have a tubular calyx, with five petals and two stamens attached to the corolla tube with yellow anthers. The fruits are black berries when ripe with 1 to 4 seeds. The fragrance that the flowers breathe is very intense and is perceived as a sweet aroma.
