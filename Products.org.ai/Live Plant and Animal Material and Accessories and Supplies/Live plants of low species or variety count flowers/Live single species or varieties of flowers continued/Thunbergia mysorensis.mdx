Thunbergia mysorensis, also called Mysore trumpetvine or Indian clock vine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Acanthaceae. A woody-stemmed evergreen, this vine is native to southern tropical India. The specific epithet mysorensis is derived from the city of Mysore. Other vernacular names include brick & butter vine, lady's slipper vine, and dolls' shoes due to the flower shape and large size.
