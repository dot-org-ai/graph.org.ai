This original Tree from Australia (Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania) can reach twenty-five meters in height and eight meters in width. Acacia dealbata has little reliable information about its flowers, but these are presumably yellow in color with hermaphroditic reproductive units. Finally: this species has evergreen leaves, serves to fix nitrogen to the soil and is scented.
