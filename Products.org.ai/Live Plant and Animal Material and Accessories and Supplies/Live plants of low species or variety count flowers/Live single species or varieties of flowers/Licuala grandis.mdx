Licuala grandis is a species of the Arecaceae family, which has a good number of almost round leaves on its trunk and can only reach 2 m in height. Its leaves resemble a circular fan, they are dark green and slightly lobed at the edge and each lobe has a small indentation that gives rise to two small teeth. The palms of this genus tend to have a tubular trunk and are better adapted to humid climates.
