Known scientifically as Colossoma macropomum, this fish is native to the Amazon and Orinoco river basins in South America. It matures rapidly and can be raised on fish farms. Reproduction on farms is artificially performed with hormonal injection. The flesh is firm and tasty, and the Colombian and Brasilian markets demand it a lot. It is important to mention that its reproduction cycle is really fast. It reaches commercial size within three to four months and weighs 300 to 350 grams.
