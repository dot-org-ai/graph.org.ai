A type of poisonous spider native to South America. Its scientific name is loxosceles laeta, a species of the sicariidae family. It is considered to be the most dangerous spider of the loxosceles genus. Its bite can generate severe systemic reactions, even death. Its web is irregular and is generally located in corners which do not trap prey effectively, hence the spider leaves to hunt its prey especially at night. Common names include arana de rincon or arana de los rincones.
