The diatraea saccharalis are lepidopter insects that are one of the most destructive insect species to cultivated plants in many agricultural producing countries, such as Argentina and United States. Their larvae feed on stems and leaves, leaving holes that damage the plant, break it, prevent the transport of nutrients and substances and are the entry way for fungi, whose toxins can be dangerous to human health. They are also known as stem borers.
