Hyenas or hyaenas are any feliform carnivoran mammals of the family Hyaenidae.  With only four extant species, it is the fifth-smallest biological family in the Carnivora, and one of the smallest in the class Mammalia.  Despite their low diversity, hyenas are unique and vital components of most African ecosystems.
