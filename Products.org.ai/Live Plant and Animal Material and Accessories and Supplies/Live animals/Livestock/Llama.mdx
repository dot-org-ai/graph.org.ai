The llama is a very strong animal that was domesticated by the inhabitants of the Andes. Their wild relatives are guanacos and vicunas. The Indians used them for centuries as pack animals, being able to support between 23 and 34 kilograms and travel with that weight up to 32 kilometers in a single day.
