# Metal folding machine

**UNSPSC Code**: 23251503
**Class**: [Metal bending machines](Metal bending machines.mdx)
**Family**: [Metal forming machinery and accessories](../Metal forming machinery and accessories.mdx)
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

Folding machines support the material through the whole cycle and the machine gauges off of the overall width of the part, not just the flange. The tooling for folding machines is almost universal, where press brakes require different tooling for every gauge and bend.
