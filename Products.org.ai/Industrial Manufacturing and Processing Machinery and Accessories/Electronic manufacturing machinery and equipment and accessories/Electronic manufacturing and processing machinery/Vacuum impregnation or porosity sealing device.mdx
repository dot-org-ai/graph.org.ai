# Vacuum impregnation or porosity sealing device

**UNSPSC Code**: 23211105
**Class**: [Electronic manufacturing and processing machinery](Electronic manufacturing and processing machinery.mdx)
**Family**: [Electronic manufacturing machinery and equipment and accessories](../Electronic manufacturing machinery and equipment and accessories.mdx)
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

A sealing device that fills all interior spaces, and may or may not leave a thin coating on the surface, depending on the wash rinse performance. The main application of vacuum impregnation porosity sealing is in boosting the dielectric strength of transformers, solenoids, lamination stacks or coils, and some high voltage components. It prevents ionization from forming between closely spaced live surfaces and initiating failure.
