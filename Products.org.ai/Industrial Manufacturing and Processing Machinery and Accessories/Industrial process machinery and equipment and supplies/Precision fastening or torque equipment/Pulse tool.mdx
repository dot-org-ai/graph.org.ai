# Pulse tool

**UNSPSC Code**: 23153701
**Class**: [Precision fastening or torque equipment](Precision fastening or torque equipment.mdx)
**Family**: [Industrial process machinery and equipment and supplies](../Industrial process machinery and equipment and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

A pulse tool combines the speed of an impact with the repeatability of a shut-off nutrunner. Shut-off pulse tools take speed and low torque reaction and add advanced automatic shut-off mechanisms to take the operator and the guesswork out of the fastening equation.
