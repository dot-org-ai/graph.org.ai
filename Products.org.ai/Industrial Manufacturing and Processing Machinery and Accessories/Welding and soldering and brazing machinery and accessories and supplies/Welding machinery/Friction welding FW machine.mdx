# Friction welding FW machine

**UNSPSC Code**: 23271416
**Class**: [Welding machinery](Welding machinery.mdx)
**Family**: [Welding and soldering and brazing machinery and accessories and supplies](../Welding and soldering and brazing machinery and accessories and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

A welding machine that employs a solid-state welding process that generates heat through mechanical friction between a moving workpiece and a stationary component. Because no melt occurs, friction welding is not actually a welding process in the traditional sense, but a forging technique.
