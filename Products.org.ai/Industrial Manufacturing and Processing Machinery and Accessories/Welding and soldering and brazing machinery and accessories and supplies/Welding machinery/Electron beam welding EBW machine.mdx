# Electron beam welding EBW machine

**UNSPSC Code**: 23271413
**Class**: [Welding machinery](Welding machinery.mdx)
**Family**: [Welding and soldering and brazing machinery and accessories and supplies](../Welding and soldering and brazing machinery and accessories and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

A type of welding machine that uses an electron beam gun to produce electrons that strike the workpiece, at which point their energy is converted into heat, instantly vaporizing the metal under temperatures near 25,000 degrees C. The heat penetrates deeply, making it possible to weld much thicker workpieces than is possible with most other welding processes. However, because the electron beam is tightly focused, the total heat input is actually much lower than that of any arc welding process.
