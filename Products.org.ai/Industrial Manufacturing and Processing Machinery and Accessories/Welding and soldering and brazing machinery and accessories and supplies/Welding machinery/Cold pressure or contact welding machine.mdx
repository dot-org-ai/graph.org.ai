# Cold pressure or contact welding machine

**UNSPSC Code**: 23271415
**Class**: [Welding machinery](Welding machinery.mdx)
**Family**: [Welding and soldering and brazing machinery and accessories and supplies](../Welding and soldering and brazing machinery and accessories and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

A type of welding machine in which joining takes place without fusion at the interface of the two parts to be welded. Unlike in the fusion-welding processes, no liquid or molten phase is present in the joint. Pressure is applied to the workpieces through dies or rolls thus producing adhesion.
