**UNSPSC Code**: 23271401
**Class**: [Welding machinery](Welding machinery.mdx)
**Family**: [Welding and soldering and brazing machinery and accessories and supplies](../Welding and soldering and brazing machinery and accessories and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

A submerged arc-welding machine creates a thick layer of flux completely covers the molten metal and prevents spatter and sparks. The flux also acts as a thermal insulator, allowing deep penetration of heat into the workpiece.
