# Electrolytic bath machine

**UNSPSC Code**: 23281502
**Class**: [Coating or plating machines](Coating or plating machines.mdx)
**Family**: [Metal treatment machinery](../Metal treatment machinery.mdx)
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

Electrolytic bath machines plate the workpiece (cathode) with a different metal (anode), while both are suspended in a bath containing a water-base electrolyte solution. The metal ions from the anode are discharged under the potential from the external source of electricity, combine with the ions in the solution, and are deposited on the cathode.
