# Induction heating machine

**UNSPSC Code**: 23281601
**Class**: [Heat treating machines](Heat treating machines.mdx)
**Family**: [Metal treatment machinery](../Metal treatment machinery.mdx)
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

The part to be heat-treated is heated rapidly by the electromagnetic field generated by an induction coil carrying alternating current, which induces eddy currents in the part. The coil may be shaped to fit the contour of the part and may be designed to also quench the part.
