# Shot peening machine

**UNSPSC Code**: 23281702
**Class**: [Mechanical surface treatment machines](Mechanical surface treatment machines.mdx)
**Family**: [Metal treatment machinery](../Metal treatment machinery.mdx)
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

Shot peening machines repeatedly hit the workpiece surface with a large number of cast steel, glass, or ceramic shot (small balls), making overlapping indentations on the surface. This process improves the fatigue life of the component and is used extensively on shafts, gears, springs, oil-well drilling equipment, and jet-engine parts.
