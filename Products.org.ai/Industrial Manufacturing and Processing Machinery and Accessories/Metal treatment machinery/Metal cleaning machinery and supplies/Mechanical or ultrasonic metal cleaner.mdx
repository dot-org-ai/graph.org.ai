# Mechanical or ultrasonic metal cleaner

**UNSPSC Code**: 23281903
**Class**: [Metal cleaning machinery and supplies](Metal cleaning machinery and supplies.mdx)
**Family**: [Metal treatment machinery](../Metal treatment machinery.mdx)
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

A type of metal cleaner that physically disturbs the contaminants, as with wire or fiber brushing, dry or wet abrasive blasting, tumbling, and steam jets. Ultrasonic cleaners use high frequency sound waves to create bubbles for loosening and removing dirt, scale, and other impurities from parts. Mechanical or ultrasonic cleaners are particularly effective in removing rust, scale, and other contaminants.
