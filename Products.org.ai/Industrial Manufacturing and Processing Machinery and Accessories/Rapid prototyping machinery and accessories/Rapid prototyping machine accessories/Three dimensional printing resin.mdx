Three-dimensional printing resin, commonly known as 3D printing resin or simply resin, is a specialized material used in resin-based 3D printing processes. Unlike traditional filament-based 3D printers, resin printers use a liquid resin that solidifies when exposed to specific wavelengths of light, typically ultraviolet (UV) light.
