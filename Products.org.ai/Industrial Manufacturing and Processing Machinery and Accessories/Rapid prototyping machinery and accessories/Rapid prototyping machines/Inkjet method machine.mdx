# Inkjet method machine

**UNSPSC Code**: 23261502
**Class**: [Rapid prototyping machines](Rapid prototyping machines.mdx)
**Family**: [Rapid prototyping machinery and accessories](../Rapid prototyping machinery and accessories.mdx)
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

This machine uses a single jet each for a plastic build material and a wax-like support material, which are held in a melted liquid state in reservoirs. The liquids are fed to individual jetting heads, which squirt tiny droplets of the materials as they are moved in X-Y fashion in the required pattern to form a layer of the object. The materials harden by rapidly dropping in temperature as they are deposited.
