# Laser powder forming machine

**UNSPSC Code**: 23261504
**Class**: [Rapid prototyping machines](Rapid prototyping machines.mdx)
**Family**: [Rapid prototyping machinery and accessories](../Rapid prototyping machinery and accessories.mdx)
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

A high power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied coaxially to the focus of the laser beam through a deposition head. The X-Y table is moved in raster fashion to fabricate each layer of the object. The head is moved up vertically as each layer is completed. Metal powders are delivered and distributed around the circumference of the head either by gravity, or by using a pressurized carrier gas.
