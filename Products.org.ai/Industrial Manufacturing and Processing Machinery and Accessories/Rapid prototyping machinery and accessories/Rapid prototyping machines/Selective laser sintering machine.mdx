# Selective laser sintering machine

**UNSPSC Code**: 23261505
**Class**: [Rapid prototyping machines](Rapid prototyping machines.mdx)
**Family**: [Rapid prototyping machinery and accessories](../Rapid prototyping machinery and accessories.mdx)
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

A roller spreads Thermoplastic powder over the surface of a build cylinder. The piston in the cylinder moves down one object layer thickness to accommodate the new layer of powder. A laser beam is then traced over the surface of this tightly compacted powder to selectively melt and bond it to form a layer of the object.
