# Three dimensional printing machine

**UNSPSC Code**: 23261507
**Class**: [Rapid prototyping machines](Rapid prototyping machines.mdx)
**Family**: [Rapid prototyping machinery and accessories](../Rapid prototyping machinery and accessories.mdx)
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

A type of printing machine that uses a process that starts by depositing a layer of powder object material at the top of a fabrication chamber. To accomplish this, a measured quantity of powder is first dispensed from a similar supply chamber by moving a piston upward incrementally. The roller then distributes and compresses the powder at the top of the fabrication chamber. The multi-channel jetting head subsequently deposits a liquid adhesive in a two dimensional pattern onto the layer of the powder which becomes bonded.
