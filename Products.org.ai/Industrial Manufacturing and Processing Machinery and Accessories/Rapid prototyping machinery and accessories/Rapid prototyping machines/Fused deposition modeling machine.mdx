# Fused deposition modeling machine

**UNSPSC Code**: 23261501
**Class**: [Rapid prototyping machines](Rapid prototyping machines.mdx)

**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

FDM is the second most widely used rapid prototyping technology. A plastic filament is unwound from a coil and supplies material to an extrusion nozzle. The nozzle is heated to melt the plastic and is moved over the table in the required geometry. The nozzle deposits a thin bead of extruded plastic to form each layer. The plastic hardens immediately after being squirted from the nozzle and bonds to the layer below.
