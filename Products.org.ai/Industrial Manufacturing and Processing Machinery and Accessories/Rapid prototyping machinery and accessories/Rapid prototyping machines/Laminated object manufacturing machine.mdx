# Laminated object manufacturing machine

**UNSPSC Code**: 23261503
**Class**: [Rapid prototyping machines](Rapid prototyping machines.mdx)
**Family**: [Rapid prototyping machinery and accessories](../Rapid prototyping machinery and accessories.mdx)
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

Profiles of object cross sections are cut from paper or other web material using a laser. The paper is unwound from a feed roll onto the stack and first bonded to the previous layer using a heated roller, which melts a plastic coating on the bottom side of the paper. The profiles are then traced by an optics system that is mounted to an X-Y stage.
