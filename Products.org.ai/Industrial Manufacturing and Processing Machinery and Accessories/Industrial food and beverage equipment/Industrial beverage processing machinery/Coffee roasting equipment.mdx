Equipment used in the coffee roasting process which follows coffee processing and precedes coffee brewing. The most common roasting machines are of two basic types: drum and hot-air, although there are others including packed bed, tangential and centrifugal roasters. Roasters can operate in either batch or continuous modes.  The roasting process consists essentially of sorting, roasting, cooling, and packaging but can also include grinding in larger scale roasting houses.
