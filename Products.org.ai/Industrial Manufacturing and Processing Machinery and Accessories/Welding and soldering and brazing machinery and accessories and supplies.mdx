# Welding and soldering and brazing machinery and accessories and supplies

**UNSPSC Code**: 23270000
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

Welding, soldering, and brazing are fabrication processes that join materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing coalescence. Welding is often done by melting the workpieces and adding a filler material to form a pool of molten material that cools to become a strong joint, but sometimes pressure is used in conjunction with heat, or by itself, to produce the weld. This is in contrast with soldering and brazing, which involve melting a lower-melting point material between the workpieces to form a bond.
