# Electrochemical machine ECM

**UNSPSC Code**: 23241502
**Class**: [Metal cutting machines](Metal cutting machines.mdx)
**Family**: [Metal cutting machinery and accessories](../Metal cutting machinery and accessories.mdx)
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

Electrochemical machining is basically the reverse of electroplating. An electrolyte acts as current carrier, and the high rate of electrolyte movement in the tool-workpiece gap washes metal ions away from the workpiece (anode) before they have the chance to plate on the tool (cathode).
