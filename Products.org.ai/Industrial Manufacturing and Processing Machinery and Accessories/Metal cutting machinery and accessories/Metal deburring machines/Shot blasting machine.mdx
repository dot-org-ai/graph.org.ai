# Shot blasting machine

**UNSPSC Code**: 23241701
**Class**: [Metal deburring machines](Metal deburring machines.mdx)
**Family**: [Metal cutting machinery and accessories](../Metal cutting machinery and accessories.mdx)
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

Machines with abrasive materials (usually sand) are propelled by a high-velocity jet of air, or by a rotating wheel, onto the surface of the workpiece. Shot blasting is particularly useful in deburring metallic and nonmetallic materials and stripping, cleaning, and removing surface oxides.
