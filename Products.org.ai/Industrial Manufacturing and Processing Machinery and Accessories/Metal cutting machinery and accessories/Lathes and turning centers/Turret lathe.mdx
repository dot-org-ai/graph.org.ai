# Turret lathe

**UNSPSC Code**: 23242305
**Class**: [Lathes and turning centers](Lathes and turning centers.mdx)

Turret lathes are capable of performing multiple cutting operations on the same workpiece, such as turning, boring, drilling, thread cutting, and facing. Several cutting tools are mounted on the main turret, which is rotated for each specific cutting operation. After the part is machined, a tool mounted on a turret, called the square turret, which moves radially into the workpiece, cuts the part off.
