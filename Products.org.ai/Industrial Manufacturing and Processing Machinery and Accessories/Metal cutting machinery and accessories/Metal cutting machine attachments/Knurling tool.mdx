# Knurling tool

This tool is used in conjunction with a lathe to emboss the ends of metal tubes and shafts. The embossed grooves may act as hand grips for the user or better traction for rubber or plastic covers. The knurling tool itself consists of multiple rotary cutters which are held against the metal shaft as it turns on the lathe at a relatively slow speed (500 rpm on average).
