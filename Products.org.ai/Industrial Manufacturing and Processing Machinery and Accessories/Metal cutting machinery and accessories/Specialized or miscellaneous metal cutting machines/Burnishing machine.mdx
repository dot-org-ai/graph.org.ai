# Burnishing machine

**UNSPSC Code**: 23242602
**Class**: [Specialized or miscellaneous metal cutting machines](Specialized or miscellaneous metal cutting machines.mdx)
**Family**: [Metal cutting machinery and accessories](../Metal cutting machinery and accessories.mdx)
**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

Burnishing machines improve the surface finish of parts through a cold-working broaching process. Burnishing removes no metal, instead it compresses and smoothes out fine surface irregularities and is used for soft, ductile materials.
