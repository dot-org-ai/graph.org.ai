**Segment**: [Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories](../../Industrial Manufacturing and Processing Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

A type of woodworking machinery that produces dowel rods. It does so by employing interchangeable cutting heads of varying diameters, thus enabling the machine to be quickly retooled to manufacture different diameters of dowel. Each head consists of a hollow chuck with cutting knives protruding inward, through which the wood passes as the knives cut it into cylindrical shape.
