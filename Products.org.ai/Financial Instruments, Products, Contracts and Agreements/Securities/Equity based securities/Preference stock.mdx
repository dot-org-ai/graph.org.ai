# Preference stock

**UNSPSC Code**: 64111503
**Class**: [Equity based securities](Equity based securities.mdx)
**Family**: [Securities](../Securities.mdx)
**Segment**: [Financial Instruments, Products, Contracts and Agreements](../../Financial Instruments, Products, Contracts and Agreements.mdx)

Like the preferred shares, preference shares have a prior claim on dividends, and on assets in an event of corporate liquidation or dissolution. But preferred stock would take precedence over preference stock in respect of dividends and assets that may be available for distribution.  Other types of these shares preclude or otherwise restrict voting rights.
