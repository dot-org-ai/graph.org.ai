# Warrant

**UNSPSC Code**: 64111804
**Class**: [Entitlements or rights](Entitlements or rights.mdx)
**Family**: [Securities](../Securities.mdx)
**Segment**: [Financial Instruments, Products, Contracts and Agreements](../../Financial Instruments, Products, Contracts and Agreements.mdx)

Financial instrument, non-standardized and usually exchanged in over the counter OTC transactions, which permits the holder to purchase a specified amount of the underlying financial instrument, commodity, currency or other during a specified period at a specified price.  Differs from a call option in that the company owning the underlying asset is the creator of the warrant, not an Exchange, and that exercise of a warrant requires creation of new stock while a call option does not.
