# Single structured product

**UNSPSC Code**: 64111904
**Class**: [Structured financial products](Structured financial products.mdx)
**Family**: [Securities](../Securities.mdx)
**Segment**: [Financial Instruments, Products, Contracts and Agreements](../../Financial Instruments, Products, Contracts and Agreements.mdx)

A security designed to facilitate highly customized risk-return objectives. This is accomplished by taking a traditional single security, and replacing the usual payment features with non-traditional payoffs derived not from the issuer's own cash flow, but from the performance of the underlying asset.
