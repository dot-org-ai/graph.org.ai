An annuity is a contract between an individual and an insurance company that is designed to meet retirement and other long-range goals, under which the individual makes a lump-sum purchase payment or series of payments. In return, the insurer agrees to make periodic payments to the annuitant beginning immediately or at some future date.  Annuities typically offer tax-deferred growth of earnings and may include a death benefit that will pay a beneficiary a specified minimum amount, such as the total purchase payments.  In a variable annuity, the annuitant can choose to invest his/her purchase payments from among a range of different investment options, typically mutual funds. The rate of return on the purchase payments, and the amount of the periodic payments the annuitant eventually receives, will vary depending on the performance of the investment options selected.
