# Futures contract, commodity

**UNSPSC Code**: 64111704
**Class**: [Derivative securities](Derivative securities.mdx)
**Family**: [Securities](../Securities.mdx)
**Segment**: [Financial Instruments, Products, Contracts and Agreements](../../Financial Instruments, Products, Contracts and Agreements.mdx)

A standardized contract between two parties, usually on the floor of a futures exchange, to buy or sell a specified bulk commodity --agricultural, extractive, industrial or services-- of standardized quantity and quality for a price agreed upon today --the futures price-- with delivery and payment occurring at a specified future date, the delivery date, making it a type of derivative instrument. The contracts are negotiated at a futures exchange, which acts as an intermediary between the two parties and serves to minimize the risk of default by either party. Thus the exchange requires both parties to put up an initial amount of cash --performance bond--, called the margin.
