A contract, usually concluded on the floor of an exchange, for buying or selling a commodity, security or currency for settlement --payment and delivery-- on the spot date, which is normally two business days after the trade date. The settlement price or rate is called spot price or spot rate. A spot contract is in contrast with a forward contract or futures contract where contract terms are agreed now but delivery and payment will occur at a future date.
