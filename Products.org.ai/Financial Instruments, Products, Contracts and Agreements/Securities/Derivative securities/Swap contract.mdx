A contract specifying the exchange of one security for another in order to change the maturity for bonds, quality of issues for stocks or bonds, or because investment objectives have changed.  Swap contracts are usually negotiated on an over the counter OTC basis, e.g. outside of a futures exchange.  Recently, swaps have grown to include currency swaps and interest rate swaps.
