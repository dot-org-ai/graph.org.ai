# Forward contract, financial

**UNSPSC Code**: 64111701
**Class**: [Derivative securities](Derivative securities.mdx)
**Family**: [Securities](../Securities.mdx)
**Segment**: [Financial Instruments, Products, Contracts and Agreements](../../Financial Instruments, Products, Contracts and Agreements.mdx)

A non-standardized contract between two parties to buy or to sell a financial asset at a specified future time at a price agreed upon today.  Usually arranged on an over the counter OTC basis, e.g., outside of an established exchange, the party agreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future assumes a long position, and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future assumes a short position. The price agreed upon is called the delivery price, which is equal to the forward price at the time the contract is entered into.  The price of the underlying instrument, in whatever form, is paid before control of the instrument changes.
