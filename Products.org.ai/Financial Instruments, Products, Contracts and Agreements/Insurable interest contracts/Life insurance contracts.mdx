Life insurance is a contract between an insured and an insurer or assurer, wherein the insurer promises to pay a designated beneficiary a sum of money --the benefits-- in exchange for a premium, upon the death of the insured person.  Depending on the contract, other events such as terminal illness or critical illness may also trigger payment. The policy holder typically pays a premium, either regularly or as a lump sum. Other expenses such as funeral expenses are also sometimes included in the benefits.
