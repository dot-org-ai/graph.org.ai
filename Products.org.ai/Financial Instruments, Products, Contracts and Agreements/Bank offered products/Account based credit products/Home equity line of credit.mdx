# Home equity line of credit

**UNSPSC Code**: 64101904
**Class**: [Account based credit products](Account based credit products.mdx)
**Family**: [Bank offered products](../Bank offered products.mdx)
**Segment**: [Financial Instruments, Products, Contracts and Agreements](../../Financial Instruments, Products, Contracts and Agreements.mdx)

A type of loan in which the lender agrees to lend a maximum amount within an agreed period where the collateral is the borrower's equity in his or her house. The borrower is not advanced the entire sum up front, but uses a line of credit to borrow sums that total no more than the credit limit, similar to a credit card. HELOC funds can be borrowed during the draw period --typically 5 to 25 years. Repayment is of the amount drawn plus interest. The full principal amount is due at the end of the draw period, either as a lump-sum balloon payment or according to a loan amortization schedule.
