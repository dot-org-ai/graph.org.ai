Intellectual property rights are legally recognized exclusive rights to creations of the mind. Under intellectual property laws and treaties such as the The World Intellectual Property Organization WIPO created in 1967, owners are granted certain exclusive rights to a variety of intangible assets, such as musical, literary, and artistic works; discoveries and inventions; and words, phrases, symbols, and designs. Common types of intellectual property rights include copyright, trademarks, patents, industrial design rights, trade dress, and in some jurisdictions trade secrets.
