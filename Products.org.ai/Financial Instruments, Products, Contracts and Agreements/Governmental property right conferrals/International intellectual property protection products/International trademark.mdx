# International trademark

**UNSPSC Code**: 64141502
**Class**: [International intellectual property protection products](International intellectual property protection products.mdx)
**Family**: [Governmental property right conferrals](../Governmental property right conferrals.mdx)
**Segment**: [Financial Instruments, Products, Contracts and Agreements](../../Financial Instruments, Products, Contracts and Agreements.mdx)

A right, recognized internationally, for exclusively identifying the commercial source or origin of products or services, e.g., the particular business as the source of goods or services. A trademark is typically a name, word, phrase, logo, symbol, design, image, or a combination of these elements.  Although there are systems which facilitate the filing, registration or enforcement of trademark rights in more than one jurisdiction on a regional or global basis it is currently not possible to file and obtain a single trademark registration which will automatically apply around the world.  Like any national law, trademark laws apply only in their applicable country or jurisdiction, a quality which is sometimes known as territoriality.  The inherent limitations of the territorial application of trademark laws have been mitigated by various intellectual property treaties, foremost amongst which is the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. TRIPS establishes legal compatibility between member jurisdictions by requiring the harmonization of applicable laws.
