A right to identify a service rather than a product, granted and recognized in the United States and several other countries.  Before it is registered, it is common practice with some legal standing to use the service mark symbol ℠ -a superscript SM.  A service mark differs from a trademark in that the mark is used on the advertising of the service rather than on the packaging or delivery of the service, since there is generally no package to place the mark on, which is the practice for trademarks.  There is no global registry for servicemarks at this time.
