# Roman shade

**UNSPSC Code**: 52131606

A type of window covering used to block out the sun. Roman shades are different from standard window shade in that they stack up evenly when being opened; however, when they are open they are visibly smooth, not bumpy or ribbed like typical vertical shades or blinds.  Roman shades are usually opened with a cord mechanism, allowing the user to adjust the height of the covered area. In typical construction, cords run vertically on the outdoor side of the blind running through evenly spaced horizontal stiffener rods or eyelets, and attached at the bottom of the blind. In this case, the opened portion of the blinds remains smooth, while the bottom will be stacked evenly.
