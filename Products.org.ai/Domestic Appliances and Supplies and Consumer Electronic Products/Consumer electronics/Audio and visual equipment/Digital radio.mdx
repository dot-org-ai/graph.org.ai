In digital radios the analog audio signal is digitized into zeros and ones, compressed using formats such as mp2, and transmitted using a digital modulation scheme. The aim is to increase the number of radio programs in a given spectrum, to improve the audio quality, to eliminate fading problems in mobile environments, to allow additional services such as pause and rewind or song or show details, and to decrease the transmission power or the number of transmitters required to cover a region.
