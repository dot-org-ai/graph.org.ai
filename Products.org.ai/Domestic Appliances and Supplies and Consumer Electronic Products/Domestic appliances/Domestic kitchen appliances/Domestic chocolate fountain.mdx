A chocolate fountain is a device for serving melted chocolate. The base is heated to keep the chocolate in a liquid state so it can be vertically transported up a central cylinder to the top of the fountain. From there it flows over tiers to create a chocolate "waterfall" into which food items like fruit or marshmallows can be dipped
