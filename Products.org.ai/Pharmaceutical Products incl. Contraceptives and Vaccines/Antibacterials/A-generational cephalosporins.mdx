# A-generational cephalosporins

**UNSPSC Code**: 51285400
**Family**: [Antibacterials](Antibacterials.mdx)
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](../Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification denotes a variety of medium-spectrum antibiotics originally isolated from the fungus cephalosporium acremonium, and which contain thia-azabicyclo-octenecarboxylic acid or 7-aminocephalosporanic acid, but which medical researchers have not yet designated as First-, Second-, Third-, Fourth-, or Fifth-Generation, hence the term A-GENERATIONAL CEPHALOSPORINS.
