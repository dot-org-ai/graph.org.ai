# Fifth generation cephalosporins

**UNSPSC Code**: 51284400
**Family**: [Antibacterials](Antibacterials.mdx)
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](../Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification denotes the original variety of broad-spectrum antibiotics originally isolated from the fungus cephalosporium acremonium, and which contain thia-azabicyclo-octenecarboxylic acid or 7-aminocephalosporanic acid, hence the term CEPHALOSPORIN. These differ from other Cephalosporins both in their chronological development and that these are effective against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a strain of Staphylococcus aureus that is non-susceptible to the action of methicillin. The mechanism of resistance usually involves modification of normal or the presence of acquired penicillin binding proteins.
