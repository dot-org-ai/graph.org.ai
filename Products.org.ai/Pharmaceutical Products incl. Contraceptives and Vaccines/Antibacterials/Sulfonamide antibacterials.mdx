# Sulfonamide antibacterials

**Family**: [Antibacterials](Antibacterials.mdx)
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](../Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification denotes a group of compounds that contain the structure SO2NH2. Members of this group, also known as sulfa drugs, are derivatives of sulfanilamide (an amide composed of a sulfonyl group connected to an amine, hence the names Sulfon-amide, Sulfonamide, Sulfonamides, or as here, Sulfonamide Antibacterials), which competitively inhibit folic acid synthesis in microorganisms, and are bacteriostatic. They have been largely supplanted by more effective and less toxic antibacterials.
