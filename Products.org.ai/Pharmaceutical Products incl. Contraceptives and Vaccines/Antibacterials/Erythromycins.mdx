# Erythromycins

**UNSPSC Code**: 51282300
**Family**: [Antibacterials](Antibacterials.mdx)
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](../Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification denotes an antibiotic variety based on a bacteriostatic produced from Streptomyces erythreus, hence the name ERYTHROMYCIN, and of which Erythromycin A is the major active component. In sensitive organisms, it inhibits protein synthesis by binding to 50S ribosomal subunits. This binding process inhibits peptidyl transferase activity and interferes with translocation of amino acids during translation and assembly of proteins.
