# Antiseptics

**UNSPSC Code**: 51470000
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification denotes substances that practitioners directly apply to humans or animals to destroy or inhibit microorganisms which cause tissue decay, fermentation, or putrefaction, substances which practitioners call ANTISEPTICS. Practitioners apply antiseptics to achieve asepsis, or a microorganism-free (or sterile) field or state. Many antiseptics are toxic, examples being so-called biocides, especially alcohols, aldehydes, anilides, biguanides, bisphenols, chlorinated hydrocarbons, creosotes and phenols, diamidines, heavy metals, iodine-based compounds, and peroxides. Antiseptics work by various mechanisms of action, including cytoplasmic (cell wall or membrane damage, leakage, or phase separation), cross-linking (cellular damage and DNA/RNA linking), breakage (DNA chain damage or inhibition), and oxidation. Some antiseptics are mutagenic, and many trigger lysis, or cell damage, dissolution, or outright destruction. Not all antiseptics, nor even a majority, demand a prescription, and many instead arise in common household preparations that faciliate wound cleaning and sterilization, such as hydrogen peroxide.
