**UNSPSC Code**: 51112500
**Family**: [Antineoplastic agents](Antineoplastic agents.mdx)
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](../Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification denotes cytotoxic chemotherapy agents, many based on C5H11Cl2N or mustine, and which chemically closely resemble - or are often identical to - WWI blister agents, substances called nitrogen mustards, that constitute reactive chemicals that introduce into biologically active molecules alkyl radicals and thereby disrupt functioning of the same, substances called alkyl-ating agents, thus the term ALKYLATING AGENT NITROGEN MUSTARD COMPOUNDS.
