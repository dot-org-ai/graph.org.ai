# Tyrosine kinase inhibitors

**UNSPSC Code**: 51112000
**Family**: [Antineoplastic agents](Antineoplastic agents.mdx)
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](../Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification denotes a protein-tyrosine kinase family that was originally identified by homology to the rous sarcoma virus oncogene protein pp60(v-src). they interact with a variety of cell-surface receptors and participate in intracellular signal transduction pathways. oncogenic forms of src-family kinases can occur through altered regulation or expression of the endogenous protein and by virally encoded src (v-src) genes.
