# Manganese-based radiopharmaceuticals, imaging agents, media, and tracers

**UNSPSC Code**: 51442500
**Family**: [Radiopharmaceuticals and contrast media](Radiopharmaceuticals and contrast media.mdx)
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](../Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification denotes particle- or wave-sensitive substances that practitioners use in to enhance visualization of bodily fluids, structures, and/or tissue, or otherwise, as biological indicators in diagnosis of disease, substances that are commonly called agents, media, or tracers, and which are also compounds based in part or whole on manganese, which practitioners use chiefly in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and/or Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), thus the term MANGANESE-BASED RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS, IMAGING AGENTS, MEDIA, AND TRACERS. Practitioners most often use such manganese-based radiopharmaceuticals, imaging agents, media, and tracers in the following studies and therapies: Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, blood pool contrast studies, carotid artery injury, cell tracking, cellular MRI, gastrointestinal imaging (as an oral agent), hepatic vascularature, hepatobiliary imaging, liver, macrophages, malignant mesothelioma detection, myocardial ischemia, myocardial perfusion, tumor angiogenesis, tumor detection and imaging, and tumor scintigraphy/therapy.
