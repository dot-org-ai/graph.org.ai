This classification denotes a variety of compounds and preparations that are sensitive to frequencies or rays common in nuclear medicine that empower practitioners to differentiate between cell or tissue types, or to bring to focus one cell or tissue type over another, and to thus examine internal body parts or systems, typically for diagnostic purposes, and which are based in part or whole on the chemical element with the symbol Na, called Sodium, and isotopes thereof, thus the term SODIUM-BASED RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS, IMAGING AGENTS, MEDIA, AND TRACERS.
