This classification denotes an iodinated contrast dye with the molecular formula C24H20I6N4O8, a preparation that US FDA regulates as an active ingredient or moiety under Unique Ingredient Identifier 82PB24K6TZ, chemically known as 5,5-(tetramethylenebis(carbonylimino))bis(n-methyl-2,4,6-triiodoisophthalamic acid) but more generally known as iocarmic acid, which bears U.S. National Institutes of Health Compound Identifier 25229. The European Medicines Agency schedules Iocarmic acid in its eXtended EudraVigilance Medicinal Product Dictionary or XEVMPD under Index SUB08208MIG. The term IOCARMIC ACID is an International Non-Proprietary Name or INN (see World Health Organization INN reference publication, Volume 24, No. 11 1970, List 10).
