This classification denotes substances that consist in whole or material part of antigens, immunoglobulins, or monoclonal antibodies that carry (or with which practitioners have infused) with radionuclides, in this case for theraputic purposes - typically to treat cancer, that reduce a human host's humoral and/or cell-mediated defense mechanisms against deviant native cells, foreign organisms, or foreign substances (the human immune response and system thereof), thus the term IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT IMMUNOCONJUGATES.
