This classification denotes immunoglobulin molecules that bear a specific amino acid sequence by virtue of which they interact exclusively with a related antigen or similar shape that induces their synthesis in lymphoid cells, molecules called antibodies, that reduce a human host's humoral and/or cell-mediated defense mechanisms against deviant native cells, foreign organisms, or foreign substances (the human immune response and system thereof), thus the term IMMUNOSUPRESSANT ANTIBODIES.
