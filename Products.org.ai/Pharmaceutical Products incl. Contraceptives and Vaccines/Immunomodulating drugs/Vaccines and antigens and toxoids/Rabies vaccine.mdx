This classification denotes a vaccine for an acute viral cns infection affecting mammals, including humans, which is caused by the rabies virus (a type species of lyssavirus) and which usually spreads by contamination with virus-laden saliva of bites of rabid animals, most especially dogs, cats, bats, foxes, raccoons, skunks, and wolves. The inactivated virus vaccine is used for preexposure immunization to persons at high risk of exposure, and in conjunction with rabies immunoglobulin, for postexposure prophylaxis.
