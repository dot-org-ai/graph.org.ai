This clasification denotes a compound vaccine. The first disease that this compound vaccine prevents is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by morbillivirus, called measles, common among children but also seen in the nonimmune of any age, in which the virus enters the respiratory tract via droplet nuclei and multiplies in the epithelial cells, spreading throughout the mononuclear phagocyte system. The second disease this compound vaccine prevents is an acute infectious disease caused by the rubella virus, commonly called rubella, and which enters the respiratory tract via airborne droplet and spreads to the lymphatic system.
