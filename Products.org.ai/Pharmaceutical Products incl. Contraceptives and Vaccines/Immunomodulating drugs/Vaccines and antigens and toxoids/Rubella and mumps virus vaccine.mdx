**UNSPSC Code**: 51201648
**Class**: [Vaccines and antigens and toxoids](Vaccines and antigens and toxoids.mdx)

This classification denotes a combination vaccine. The first component of this combination vaccine addresses that acute infectious disease caused by the rubella virus, of type species of rubivirus causing acute infection in humans, primarily children and young adults, and which enters the respiratory tract via airborne droplet and spreads to the lymphatic system. The second component of this combination vaccine addresses an acute infectious disease caused by rubulavirus (a genus of the family paramyxoviridae and subfamily paramyxovirinae, where all the species have hemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities but lack a C protein), which is spread by direct contact, airborne droplet nuclei, fomites contaminated by infectious saliva, and perhaps urine, and usually seen in children under the age of 15, although adults may also be affected.
