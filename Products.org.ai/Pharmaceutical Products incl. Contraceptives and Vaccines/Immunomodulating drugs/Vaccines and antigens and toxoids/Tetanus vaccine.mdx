This classification denotes a vaccine against a disease caused by tetanospasmin, a powerful protein toxin produced by clostridium tetani, a disease commonly called Tetanus. Tetanus usually occurs after an acute injury, such as a puncture wound or laceration. Generalized tetanus, the most common form, is characterized by tetanic muscular contractions and hyperreflexia. Localized tetanus presents itself as a mild condition with manifestations restricted to muscles near the wound. It may progress to the generalized form.
