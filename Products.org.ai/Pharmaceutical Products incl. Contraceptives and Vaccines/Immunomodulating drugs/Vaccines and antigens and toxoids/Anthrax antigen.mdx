This clasification denotes preparations recognized by the immune system and which induce an immune reaction to an acute infection caused by the spore-forming bacteria bacillus anthracis, an infection called anthrax. It commonly affects hoofed animals such as sheep and goats. Infection in humans often involves the skin (cutaneous anthrax), the lungs (inhalation anthrax), or the gastrointestinal tract. Anthrax is not contagious and can be treated with antibiotics.
