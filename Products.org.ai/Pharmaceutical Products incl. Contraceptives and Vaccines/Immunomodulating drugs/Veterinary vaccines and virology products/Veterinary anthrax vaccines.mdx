# Veterinary anthrax vaccines

**UNSPSC Code**: 51204202
**Class**: [Veterinary vaccines and virology products](Veterinary vaccines and virology products.mdx)
**Family**: [Immunomodulating drugs](../Immunomodulating drugs.mdx)
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](../../Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification denotes preparations containing substances with antigenic properties administered to activate veterinary or non-human immune systems, thereby inducing immune responses, preparations called vaccines, of which the current commodities address or prevent infectious Anthrax, a disease caused by the spore-forming bacteria Bacillus anthracis, the same disease that USNLM codifies in MeSH UID D000881 and which afflicts hooved animals such as sheep and goats, thus the term ANTHRAX VACCINES.
