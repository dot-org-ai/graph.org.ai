This clasification denotes vaccines or candidate vaccines used to prevent or treat infections from a species of gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria (gram-negative facultatively anaerobic rods) commonly found in the lower part of the intestine of warm-blooded animals. It is usually nonpathogenic, but some strains are known to produce diarrhea and pyogenic infections. Pathogenic strains (virotypes) are classified by their specific pathogenic mechanisms such as toxins ( enterotoxigenic escherichia coli), etc.
