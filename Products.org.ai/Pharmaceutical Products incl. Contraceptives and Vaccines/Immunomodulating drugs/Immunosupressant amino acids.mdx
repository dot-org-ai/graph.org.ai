**UNSPSC Code**: 51202300
**Family**: [Immunomodulating drugs](Immunomodulating drugs.mdx)
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](../Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification denotes organic compounds that contain an amino (-NH2) and a carboxyl (-COOH) group and which generally polymerize to form proteins, substances called amino-acids, that reduce a human host's humoral and/or cell-mediated defense mechanisms against deviant native cells, foreign organisms, or foreign substances (the human immune response and system thereof), thus the term IMMUNOSUPRESSANT AMINO ACIDS.
