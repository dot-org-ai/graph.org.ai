# Immunosupressant nucleic acids, nucleotides, and nucleosides

**UNSPSC Code**: 51202900
**Family**: [Immunomodulating drugs](Immunomodulating drugs.mdx)
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](../Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification denotes a) high-molecular-weight deoxyribose-chained or ribose-chained purine and pyrimidine nucleotide polymers, substances called nucleic acids; b) purine/pyrimidine-based monomeric units, which also contain pentose sugar and phosphate, from whence DNA/RNA polymers derive their composition, substances called nucleotides; or c) purine or pyrimidine bases bound to a deoxyribose or ribose, substances called nucleosides, all/any of which reduce a human host's humoral and/or cell-mediated defense mechanisms against deviant native cells, foreign organisms, or foreign substances (the human immune response and system thereof), thus the term IMMUNOSUPRESSANT NUCLEIC ACIDS, NUCLEOTIDES, AND NUCLEOSIDES.
