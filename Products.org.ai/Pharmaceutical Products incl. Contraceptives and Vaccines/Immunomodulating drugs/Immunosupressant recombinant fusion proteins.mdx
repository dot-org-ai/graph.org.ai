**UNSPSC Code**: 51204100
**Family**: [Immunomodulating drugs](Immunomodulating drugs.mdx)
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](../Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification denotes substances produced by genetic translation of fused genes formed by the combination of nucleic acid regulatory sequences, substances called recombinant fusion proteins, that reduce a human host's humoral and/or cell-mediated defense mechanisms against deviant native cells, foreign organisms, or foreign substances (the human immune response and system thereof), thus the term IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT RECOMBINANT FUSION PROTEINS.
