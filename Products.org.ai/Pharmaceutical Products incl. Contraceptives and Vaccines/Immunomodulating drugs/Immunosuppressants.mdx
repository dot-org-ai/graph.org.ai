This classification denotes agents that suppress immune function by one of several mechanisms of action. classical cytotoxic immunosuppressants act by inhibiting dna synthesis. others may act through activation of t-cells or by inhibiting the activation of helper cells. while immunosuppression has been brought about in the past primarily to prevent rejection of transplanted organs, new applications involving mediation of the effects of interleukins and other cytokines are emerging.
