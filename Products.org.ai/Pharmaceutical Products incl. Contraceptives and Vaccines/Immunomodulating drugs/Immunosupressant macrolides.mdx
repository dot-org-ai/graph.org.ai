This classification denotes macro-cyclic compounds that form by chain extension of multiple propionates cyclized into 12, 14, or 16-membered lactones, compounds called macrolides, that reduce a human host's humoral and/or cell-mediated defense mechanisms against deviant native cells, foreign organisms, or foreign substances (the human immune response and system thereof), thus the term IMMUNOSUPRESSANT MACROLIDES.
