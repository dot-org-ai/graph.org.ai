# Ethyl alcohol antiseptic

**UNSPSC Code**: 51471905
**Class**: [Antiseptic alcohols](Antiseptic alcohols.mdx)
**Family**: [Antiseptics](../Antiseptics.mdx)
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](../../Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

A solution of 70% ethanol is more effective than pure ethanol because ethanol relies on wsater molecules for optimal antimicrobial activity.
