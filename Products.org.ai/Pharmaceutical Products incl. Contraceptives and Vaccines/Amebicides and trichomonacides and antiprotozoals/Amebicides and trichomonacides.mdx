# Amebicides and trichomonacides

**UNSPSC Code**: 51101600
**Family**: [Amebicides and trichomonacides and antiprotozoals](Amebicides and trichomonacides and antiprotozoals.mdx)
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](../Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification denotes drugs that destroy amebae or protozoans, parasitic organisms, and species thereof which cause amebiasis in man and animal. Amebae are organisms that evince a vesicular nucleus and formation of several lodopodia, one of which is dominant at a given time, and which reproduce asexually by binary fission. Such organsms give rise to afflictions such as acanthamoeba keratitis, blastocystis, amebic dysentery, entamoebiasis, and amebic liver abscess, or cause central nervous system parasitic infections, helminthiasis, mesomycetozoea infections, and parasitemia. Common conditions that this classification's drugs treat include anisakiasis, balantidiasis, cryptosporidiosis, dientamoebiasis, entamoebiasis, fascioliasis, giardiasis, hepatic echinococcosis, and rhinosporidiosis. These drugs, known as AMEBICIDES, ANTIPROTOZOALS, and TRICHOMONACIDES, typically target a) a genus of coccidian parasites of the family cryptosporidiidae, found in the intestinal epithelium of many vertebrates including humans,known as cryptosporidium; and b) an order of parasitic eukaryotes typically having four to six flagella, know as trichomonadida.
