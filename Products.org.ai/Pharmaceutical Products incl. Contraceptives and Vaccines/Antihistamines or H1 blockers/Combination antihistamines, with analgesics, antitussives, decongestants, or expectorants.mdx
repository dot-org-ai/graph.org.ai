This classification denotes a) combination drugs containing preparations that bind to but do not activate histamine receptors, thereby blocking the actions of histamine or histamine agonists, thus the term ANTIHISTAMINES, and which thereby act in the bronchi, capillaries, and other smooth muscles to prevent or allay motion sickness, seasonal rhinitis, and allergic dermatitis and to induce somnolence; b) combination drugs containing preparations capable of relieving pain without the loss of consciousness, or of creating a condition of non-pain, hence the term ANALGESICS; c) combination drugs containing preparations that suppress cough, hence the term ANTITUSSIVES; d) containing preparations designed to treat inflammation of the nasal passages, hence the term DECONGESTANTS; and/or e) combination drugs containing preparations that increase mucous excretion, hence the term EXPECTORANTS. Typical combination antihistamine, with analgesic, antitussive, decongestant, or expectorant constituents are azatadine, bromphenhiramine, carbetapentane, desloratadine, fexofenadine, loratadine, menthol, phenylephrine, and pseudoephedrine.
