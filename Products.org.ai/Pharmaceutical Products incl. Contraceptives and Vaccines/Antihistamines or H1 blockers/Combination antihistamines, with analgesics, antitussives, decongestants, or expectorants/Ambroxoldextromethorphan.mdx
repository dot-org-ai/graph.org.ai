This classification denotes a combination drug composed of two constituents: a mucolytic and an opioid receptor agonist and opioid, as more fully appears. The first constituent, ambroxol (51162702), is an expectorant and amino-alcohol that bears the molecular formula C13H18BR2N2O, a preparation that US FDA regulates as an active ingredient or moiety under Unique Ingredient Identifier 200168S0CL, chemically known as 4-[(2-Amino-3,5-dibromobenzyl)amino]cyclohexanol but more generally known as ambroxol [EU/ESIS 242-500-3]; ambroxol comes in forms acefyllinate [0HM1E174TN], base, and hydrochloride [CC995ZMV90]. European Medicines Agency schedules AMBROXOL in its eXtended EudraVigilance Medicinal Product Dictionary or XEVMPD under Index SUB05397MIG (base), SUB12842MIG (acefyllinate), and SUB00427MIG (hydrochloride). The term AMBROXOL is an International Non-Proprietary Name or INN. World Health Organization schedules ambroxol in its Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification (R05CB06) and in its WHO Drug Dictionary. AMBROXOL is scheduled in the U.S. International Trade Commission's Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) Pharmaceutical Appendix. Most nations schedule ambroxol under HS 29221980 and SITC 51461. US Census, for industry purposes, classifies ambroxol under NAICS 325199. The second component of this combination drug, dextromethorphan (51162626), is an opioid receptor agonist and opioid with the molecular formula C18H25NO, a preparation that US FDA regulates as an active ingredient or moiety under Unique Ingredient Identifier (SRS UNII) 7355X3ROTS, chemically known as 2h-10,4a-iminoethanophenanthrene, 1,3,4,9,10,10a-hexahydro-6-methoxy-11-methyl- but more generally known as dextromethorphan, which bears US NIH Compound Identifier 3008. Dextromethorphan {51162626} comes in forms base, hydriodide, hydrobromide, hydrobromide anhydrous, hydrochloride, salicylate, and tannate ([086F8ZEM77], [9D2RTI9KYH], [351KFH969D], [B2F298X1AJ], [554R584P9K]); it further serves in many other combination drugs with doxylamine, dyphylline, glycerol, guaifenesin, ipecac, phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, potassium, promethazine, pseudoephedrine, quinidine, terpin hydrate ({51143708}, {51162018}, {51162401}, {51162408}, {51162409}, {51162410}, {51162411}, {51162412}, {51162510}, {51162511}, {51314363}, {51314364}, {51314365}, {51314366}, {51314367}, {51314368}). European Medicines Agency schedules Dextromethorphan in its eXtended EudraVigilance Medicinal Product Dictionary or XEVMPD under Index SUB07051MIG. The term DEXTROMETHORPHAN is an International Non-Proprietary Name. World Health Organization schedules dextromethorphan in its Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification. DEXTROMETHORPHAN is scheduled in the U.S. International Trade Commission's Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) Pharmaceutical Appendix. Most nations, for tariff and trade purposes, schedule dextromethorphan under HS 29334930 and SITC 51575. As of Q4 2014, DEXTROMETHORPHAN remains US FDA's Preferred Term for this commodity. Dextromethorphan bears US NLM identifiers UMLS ID C0011816 and NCI Concept Code C62022.
