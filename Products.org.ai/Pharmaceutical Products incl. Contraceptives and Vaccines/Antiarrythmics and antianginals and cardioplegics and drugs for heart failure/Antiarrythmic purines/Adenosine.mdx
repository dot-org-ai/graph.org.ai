This classification denotes a nucleoside with the molecular formula C10H13N5O4, a preparation that US FDA regulates as an active ingredient or moiety under Unique Ingredient Identifier (SRS UNII) K72T3FS567, chemically known as 9h-purin-6-amine, 9-beta-d-xylofuranosyl- (9ci) but more generally known as adenosine, which bears US NIH Compound Identifier 191. Adenosine comes in many forms, including arabinose, arabinoside-5-phosphate, cyclic 3,5-phosphate, dialdehyde, diphosphate, diphosphoglucose, diphosphopyridoxal, diphosphoribose, diphosphoric acid, monophosphofluoridate, oxide, phosphate, phosphonoacetic acid, phosphosulfate, sulfatophosphate, tetraphosphate, tetraphosphate pyridoxal, thiamine triphosphate, and triphosphate. European Medicines Agency schedules Adenosine in its eXtended EudraVigilance Medicinal Product Dictionary or XEVMPD under Index SUB00297MIG. World Health Organization schedules adenosine in its Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification. ADENOSINE is scheduled in the U.S. International Trade Commission's Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) Pharmaceutical Appendix. Most nations, for tariff and trade purposes, schedule adenosine under HS 29349990 and SITC 51579. As of Q4 2014, ADENOSINE remains US FDA's Preferred Term for this commodity. Adenosine bears US NLM identifiers UMLS ID C0001443 and NCI Concept Code C207. SMILES: C1=NC2=C(C(=N1)N)N=CN2C3C(C(C(O3)CO)O)O.
