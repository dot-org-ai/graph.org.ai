# Antiarrythmic cyclic hydrocarbons

**UNSPSC Code**: 51123700
**Family**: [Antiarrythmics and antianginals and cardioplegics and drugs for heart failure](Antiarrythmics and antianginals and cardioplegics and drugs for heart failure.mdx)
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](../Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification denotes organic compounds composed of carbon and hydrogen alone (hydrogen-carbon), but forming a closed ring, substances called cyclic hydrocarbons, that prevent or treat irregular heartbeat, disturbances of normal rhythmic heart beating, or normal operation of myocardial contraction, thus the term ANTIARRYTHMIC CYCLIC HYDROCARBONS.
