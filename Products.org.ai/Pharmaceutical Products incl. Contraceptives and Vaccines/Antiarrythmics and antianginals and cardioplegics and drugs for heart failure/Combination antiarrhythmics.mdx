This classification denotes combination preparations for the treatment or prevention of disturbances of the normal rhythmic beating of the heart. they may affect the polarization-repolarization phase of the action potential, its excitability or refractoriness, or impulse conduction or membrane responsiveness within cardiac fibers. anti-arrhythmia agents are often classed into four main groups according to their mechanism of action: sodium channel blockade, beta-adrenergic blockade, repolarization prolongation, or calcium channel blockade. Typical combination antiarrhythmic constituients are bretylium, dextrose, and lidocaine.
