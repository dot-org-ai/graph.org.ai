**UNSPSC Code**: 51122600
**Family**: [Antiarrythmics and antianginals and cardioplegics and drugs for heart failure](Antiarrythmics and antianginals and cardioplegics and drugs for heart failure.mdx)

This classification denotes combination drugs that lower the levels of certain lipids (or alcohol-ether-soluble constituents of protoplasm) in the blood, such as fats, phospholipids, glycolipids, sulfolipids, aminolipids, chromolipids, and which therefore treat hyperlipidemia, hence the term ANTILIPEMIC AGENTS. Typical combination antilipemic agent constituents are aspirin, cholestyramine, ezetimibe, lovastatin, and niacin.
