**UNSPSC Code**: 51124400
**Family**: [Antiarrythmics and antianginals and cardioplegics and drugs for heart failure](Antiarrythmics and antianginals and cardioplegics and drugs for heart failure.mdx)

This classification denotes c(23)-steroids with methyl groups at c-10 and c-13 and a five-membered c-17 lactone, substances chemically called cardenolides, many of which constitute cardiac glycosides -- or Cyclopentanophenanthrenes that adhere to the aforesaid structure but also bind sugars at position 3 - and that prevent or treat irregular heartbeat, disturbances of normal rhythmic heart beating, or normal operation of myocardial contraction, thus the term ANTIARRYTHMIC CARDIAC GLYCOSIDES OR CARDENOLIDES.
