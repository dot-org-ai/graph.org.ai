This classification denotes combination drugs and preparations that do not bind to opioid receptors, which do not derive from opium or morphine, which are non-addictive, and which are not narcotics, that a) suppress cough, hence the term ANTITUSSIVES; and/or b) increase mucous excretion, hence the term EXPECTORANTS. These drugs therefore bear the names NON-OPIOID-CONTAINING ANTITUSSIVES and NON-OPIOID-CONTAINING EXPECTORANTS. Typical combination non-opioid-containing antitussive/expectorant constituents are antimony, antimony potassium tartrate, dextromethorphan, glycerol, iodinated, guaifenesin, iodine, ipecac, potassium guaiacolsulfonate, potassium iodide, and terpin hydrate.
