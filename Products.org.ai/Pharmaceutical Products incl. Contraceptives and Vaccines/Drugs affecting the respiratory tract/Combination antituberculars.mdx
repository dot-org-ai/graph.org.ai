This classification denotes combination drugs used in the treatment of tuberculosis, any of the infectious diseases of man and other animals caused by species of mycobacterium. such drugs are divided into two main classes: first-line agents, those with the greatest efficacy and acceptable degrees of toxicity used successfully in the great majority of cases; and second-line drugs used in drug-resistant cases or those in which some other patient-related condition has compromised the effectiveness of primary therapy. Typical combination antitubercular constituents are isoniazid, pyrazinamide, pyridoxine, and rifampin.
