The first constituent, ambroxol (51162702), is an expectorant and amino-alcohol that bears the molecular formula C13H18BR2N2O, a preparation that US FDA regulates as an active ingredient or moiety under Unique Ingredient Identifier 200168S0CL, chemically known as 4-[(2-Amino-3,5-dibromobenzyl)amino]cyclohexanol but more generally known as ambroxol [EU/ESIS 242-500-3]; ambroxol comes in forms acefyllinate [0HM1E174TN], base, and hydrochloride [CC995ZMV90]. European Medicines Agency schedules AMBROXOL in its eXtended EudraVigilance Medicinal Product Dictionary or XEVMPD under Index SUB05397MIG (base), SUB12842MIG (acefyllinate), and SUB00427MIG (hydrochloride). The term AMBROXOL is an International Non-Proprietary Name or INN.

US Census, for industry purposes, classifies ambroxol under NAICS 325199. The second component of this combination drug, salbutamol (51391703), is a bronchodilator and beta-adrenergic agonist with the molecular formula C13H21NO3, a preparation that US FDA regulates as an active ingredient or moiety under Unique Ingredient Identifier QF8SVZ843E, chemically known as 1,3-benzenedimethanol, alpha(sup 1)-(((1,1-dimethylethyl)amino)methyl)-4-hydroxy- but generally known as albuterol, which bears US NIH Compound Identifier 2083.
