# Combination contraceptives and estrogens

**UNSPSC Code**: 51352400
**Family**: [Estrogens and progestins and internal contraceptives](Estrogens and progestins and internal contraceptives.mdx)
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](../Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification denotes combination drugs and preparations that a) prevent or reduce probability of fusion of a spermatozoon with an ovum thus resulting in the formation of a zygote (or fertilization), that process called conception, hence the term contraceptives; and/or b) interact with estrogen receptors (or Cytoplasmic proteins that bind estrogens and migrate to the nucleus where they regulate DNA transcription) in target tissues and which thereby stimulate human female reproductive organs. Typical combination contraceptive and estrogen constituents are chlordiazepoxide, desogestrel, dienogest, drospirenone, estradiol, estrogens, ethinyl estradiol, ethynodiol, and mestranol.
