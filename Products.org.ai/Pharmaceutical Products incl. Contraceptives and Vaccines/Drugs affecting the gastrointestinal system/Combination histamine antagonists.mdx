**UNSPSC Code**: 51173100
**Family**: [Drugs affecting the gastrointestinal system](Drugs affecting the gastrointestinal system.mdx)
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](../Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification denotes combination drugs containing preparations that bind to but do not activate histamine receptors, thereby blocking the actions of histamine or histamine agonists, thus the term ANTIHISTAMINES, and which thereby act in the bronchi, capillaries, and other smooth muscles to prevent or allay motion sickness, seasonal rhinitis, and allergic dermatitis and to induce somnolence. Typical combination histamine antagonist constituents are dextrose and sodium chloride.
