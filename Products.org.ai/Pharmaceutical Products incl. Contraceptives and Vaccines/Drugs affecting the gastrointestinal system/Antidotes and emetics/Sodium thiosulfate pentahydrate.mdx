A medication used as an antidote in cases of cyanide poisoning.  Thiosulfate acts as a sulfur donor to produce the conversion of cyanide to thiocyanate, which can then be safely excreted through urine, that conversion is catalyzed by the enzyme rhodamine (rhodanase). It has also been used as a treatment for calciphylaxis in patients undergoing hemodialysis, who have chronic kidney disease. It is also used in the management of extravasation of urine in chemotherapy. Sodium thiosulfate prevents alkylation and tissue destruction, providing a substrate for the alkylating agents that have invaded the subcutaneous tissues. It is also used in foot baths for the prophylaxis of dermatophytosis and as a topical antifungal agent for Pityriasis versicolor.
