**Family**: [Hormones and hormone antagonists](Hormones and hormone antagonists.mdx)

This classification denotes combination drugs and preparations that stimulate contraction of the myometrium, medically used to, for example, induce labor, or control postpartum or postabortion hemorrhage, or, in some cases, to induce abortion, which derive from the nonapeptide hormone oxytocin, and which therefore bear the term OXYTOCICS. Typical combination oxytocic constituents are dextrose and oxytocin.
