**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification denotes agents that control agitated psychotic behavior, alleviate acute psychotic states, reduce psychotic symptoms, and exert a quieting effect. They are used in SCHIZOPHRENIA; senile dementia; transient psychosis following surgery; or MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION; etc. These drugs are often referred to as neuroleptics alluding to the tendency to produce neurological side effects, but not all antipsychotics are likely to produce such effects.
