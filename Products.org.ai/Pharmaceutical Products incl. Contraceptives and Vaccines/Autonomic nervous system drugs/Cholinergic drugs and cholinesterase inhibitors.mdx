# Cholinergic drugs and cholinesterase inhibitors

**UNSPSC Code**: 51151500
**Family**: [Autonomic nervous system drugs](Autonomic nervous system drugs.mdx)
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](../Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification denotes drugs that inhibit cholinesterases. the neurotransmitter acetylcholine is rapidly hydrolyzed, and thereby inactivated, by cholinesterases. when cholinesterases are inhibited, the action of endogenously released acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses is potentiated. cholinesterase inhibitors are widely used clinically for their potentiation of cholinergic inputs to the gastrointestinal tract and urinary bladder, the eye, and skeletal muscles; they are also used for their effects on the heart and the central nervous system.
