# Combination antimuscarinic and antipasmodics

**UNSPSC Code**: 51152100
**Family**: [Autonomic nervous system drugs](Autonomic nervous system drugs.mdx)
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](../Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification denotes combination drugs that bind to but do not activate muscarinic receptors (or cholinergic receptors that prefer muscarine rather than nicotine), and thus block actions of endogenous acetylcholine, hence the term ANTIMUSCARINICS. Antimuscarinics affect the iris and ciliary muscle of the eye, heart and blood vessels, respiratory tract secretions, gastrointestinal system, salivary glands, urinary bladder tone, and the central nervous system. Typical combination antimuscarinic and antipasmodic constituents are atropine, belladonna, chlordiazepoxide, dicyclomine, hydroxyzine, hyoscyamine, hyoscyamus, and meprobamate.
