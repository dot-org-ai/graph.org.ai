# Nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs

**UNSPSC Code**: 51380000
**Segment**: [Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines](Pharmaceutical Products incl. Contraceptives and Vaccines.mdx)

This classification codifies anti-inflammatory agents that are not steroids. in addition to anti-inflammatory actions, they have analgesic, antipyretic, and platelet-inhibitory actions. they are used primarily in the treatment of chronic arthritic conditions and certain soft tissue disorders associated with pain and inflammation. they act by blocking the synthesis of prostaglandins by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, which converts arachidonic acid to cyclic endoperoxides, precursors of prostaglandins. inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis accounts for their analgesic, antipyretic, and platelet-inhibitory actions; other mechanisms may contribute to their anti-inflammatory effects.
