This classification denotes combination drugs and preparations that promote excretion of urine by influencing human kidney function, commonly known as DIURETICS. The major diuretic types include osmotic (diuretics that increase urine volume by increasing osmotically-active urine solute); potassium sparing (diuretics that limit potassium secretion in urine); sodium chloride symporter inhibitors; and sodium potassium chloride symporter inhibitors. Diuretics, that is, operate by stimulating he nervous system, by alleviating kidney congestion, by increasing blood pressure, or by increasing or improving liquid transport. Typical combination diuretic constituents are hydrochlorothiazide, potassium chloride, spironolactone, and triamterene.
