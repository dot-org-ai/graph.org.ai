Concrete mattresses are widely used within the offshore industry for scour control, stabilization, and protection. There is currently no uniform industry methodology for concrete mattress stability design for any application of concrete mattresses.  This methodology encompasses the application of recognized pipeline codes and standards, and the requirements and results of 2D and 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling as well as physical model testing.
