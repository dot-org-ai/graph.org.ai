# Double-paned window

**UNSPSC Code**: 30171616
**Class**: [Windows](Windows.mdx)
**Family**: [Doors and windows and glass](../Doors and windows and glass.mdx)
**Segment**: [Structures and Building and Construction and Manufacturing Components and Supplies](../../Structures and Building and Construction and Manufacturing Components and Supplies.mdx)

A type of window that has two parallel panes (slabs of glass) with a separation of typically about 1 cm; this space is permanently sealed and filled at the time of manufacture with dry air or other dry nonreactive gas. Such windows provide a marked improvement in thermal insulation (and usually in acoustic insulation as well) and are resistant to fogging and frosting caused by temperature differential.
