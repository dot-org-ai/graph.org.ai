A type of hearing protection device, also known as an HPD, worn in or over the ears while exposed to hazardous noise to protect against noise-induced hearing loss. HPDs reduce (not eliminate) the level of the noise entering the ear. HPDs can also protect against other effects of noise exposure such as tinnitus and hyperacusis.
