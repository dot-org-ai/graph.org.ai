# Fire extinguishing ball or patch

**UNSPSC Code**: 46191622

A passive fire suppression or extinguishing device consisting of a hard foam shell or ball wrapped in fuses that lead to a small black powder charge within. The ball bursts shortly after contact with flame at a specific temperature, dispersing a cloud of ABC dry chemical powder which extinguishes the fire. The coverage area is about 5 m2 (54 sq ft). One benefit of this type is that it may be used for passive suppression. The ball can be placed in a fire-prone area and will deploy automatically if a fire develops, being triggered by heat. It may also be manually operated by rolling or tossing into a fire. Most modern extinguishers of this type are designed to make a loud noise upon deployment.
