The fire extinguisher's recharge system allows for the valve to be reassembled and installed back onto the cylinder. The cylinder is refilled with an extinguishing agent (carbon dioxide, dry chemical, wet chemical, water, etc.) as specified in the recharging instructions. The extinguisher is re-pressurized until the gauge indicates a full charge.
