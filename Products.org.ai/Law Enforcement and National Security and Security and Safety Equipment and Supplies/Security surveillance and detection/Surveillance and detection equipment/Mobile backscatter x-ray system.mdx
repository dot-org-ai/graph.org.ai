# Mobile backscatter x-ray system

**UNSPSC Code**: 46171648
**Class**: [Surveillance and detection equipment](Surveillance and detection equipment.mdx)
**Family**: [Security surveillance and detection](../Security surveillance and detection.mdx)
**Segment**: [Law Enforcement and National Security and Security and Safety Equipment and Supplies](../../Law Enforcement and National Security and Security and Safety Equipment and Supplies.mdx)

Backscatter machines use rotating collimators to generate X-rays, which pass through a slit and strike a passenger standing inside. The X-rays penetrate clothing, bounce off the person's skin and return to detectors mounted on the machine's surface.
