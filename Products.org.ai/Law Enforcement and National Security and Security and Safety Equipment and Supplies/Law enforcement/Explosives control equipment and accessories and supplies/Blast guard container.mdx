# Blast guard container

**UNSPSC Code**: 46151801
**Class**: [Explosives control equipment and accessories and supplies](Explosives control equipment and accessories and supplies.mdx)
**Family**: [Law enforcement](../Law enforcement.mdx)
**Segment**: [Law Enforcement and National Security and Security and Safety Equipment and Supplies](../../Law Enforcement and National Security and Security and Safety Equipment and Supplies.mdx)

A special type of reinforced container combining a high strength outer steel shell with an inner compressive layer for the safe disposal of explosive devices.  The compressive layer is designed to absorb the major blast energy and resist fragmentation. The outer shell restrains any remaining lateral blast energy and fragmentation. Residual blast energy is vented upwards away from the public, keeping the receptacle unpenetrated.
