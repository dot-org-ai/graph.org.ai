To improve the response time and effectiveness of the UNHRD Rapid Response Team, a fully equipped office kit and accommodation plan must be provided. This kit must accommodate 12 staff members for a period of 3 months in various climates. Since emergency areas are sporadic and unknown, the custom kit must be able to withstand harsh conditions such as sunlight exposure, extreme heat, heavy wind and rain and wet ground conditions. Based off of previous emergency response occasions, the UNHRD has determined that the kit must include: Tents to house an office, accommodation and kitchen, internal and external lighting with internal wiring, kitchen equipment, power equipment, tools and furniture, air conditioning. The solution must be stored in the all HRD warehouses, high risk locations and/or humanitarian storage areas in a ready-to-go formations so that when crisis occurs, the emergency response team can deploy quickly and easily.
