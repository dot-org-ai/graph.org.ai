This family describes a shelter, which is defined as a habitable covered living space providing a secure and healthy living environment with privacy and dignity. Shelters must provide protection from the elements, space to live and store belongings, privacy and emotional security. Blankets, mats, and tarpaulin must be provided as needed. Refugee shelter should be culturally and socially appropriate and familiar where possible. Suitable local materials are best, if available. Shelter must be adequate regardless of seasonal weather patterns, if not it should be adapted accordingly.
