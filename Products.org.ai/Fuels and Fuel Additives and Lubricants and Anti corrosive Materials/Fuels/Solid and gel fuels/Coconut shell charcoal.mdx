**Segment**: [Fuels and Fuel Additives and Lubricants and Anti corrosive Materials](../../Fuels and Fuel Additives and Lubricants and Anti corrosive Materials.mdx)

A type of activated carbon manufactured from coconut shell which is considered superior to other sources mainly because of the small macropore structure of coconut shells which renders them more effective for the adsorption of gas/ vapour and for the removal of color, oxidants, impurities and odor of compounds.
