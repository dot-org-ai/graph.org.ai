# Metallurgical coal

**UNSPSC Code**: 15101612
**Class**: [Solid and gel fuels](Solid and gel fuels.mdx)
**Family**: [Fuels](../Fuels.mdx)
**Segment**: [Fuels and Fuel Additives and Lubricants and Anti corrosive Materials](../../Fuels and Fuel Additives and Lubricants and Anti corrosive Materials.mdx)

A type of coal, usually anthracite, used primarily in the iron making process specifically for producing coke which acts as a reducing agent, e.g., strips off oxygen from iron ore. This is the high level distinction between coal used for metallurgical reasons --processing of ores to produce metals-- versus coal used for heating purposes--energy or thermal coal used in power stations or other furnaces.
