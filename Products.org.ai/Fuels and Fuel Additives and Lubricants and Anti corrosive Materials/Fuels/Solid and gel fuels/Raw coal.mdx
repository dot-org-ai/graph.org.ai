Raw coal is coal that contains dilution material e.g. tramp iron, timber, and strong rocks or increased ash content. It is coal that is typically washed before to produce a more marketable metallurgical or energy coal. It is a product that can be sold in the raw form to other parties that prefer an unwashed coal or other parties that have facilities to wash the coal themselves.
