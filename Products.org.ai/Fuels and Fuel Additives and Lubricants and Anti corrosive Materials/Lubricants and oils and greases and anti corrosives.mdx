# Lubricants and oils and greases and anti corrosives

**UNSPSC Code**: 15120000
**Segment**: [Fuels and Fuel Additives and Lubricants and Anti corrosive Materials](Fuels and Fuel Additives and Lubricants and Anti corrosive Materials.mdx)

A lubricant is a substance that helps to reduce friction between surfaces in mutual contact, which ultimately reduces the heat generated when the surfaces move. It may also have the function of transmitting forces, transporting foreign particles, or heating or cooling the surfaces.
