# Pour ​​point depressant

**UNSPSC Code**: 15121535

A Pour ​​point depressant is an additive (polymer) that allows oils and lubricants to flow at very low temperatures without the heavy wax formation at these cold temperatures and enables the oil to remain pumpable (flowable). They are typically used in paraffinic base oils in applications where extremely low machine startup temperature conditions are possible. Most paraffinic motor oils use pour point depressors. Pour Point Depressants work as modifiers & modify the interface between the crystallized wax and the oil.
