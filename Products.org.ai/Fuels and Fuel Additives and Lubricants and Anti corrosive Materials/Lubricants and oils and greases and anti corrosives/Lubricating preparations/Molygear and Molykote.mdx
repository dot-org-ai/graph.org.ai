Molykote is an anti-seize thread compound, which means that it helps to lubricate certain fasteners to help reduce friction. Moly Universal Gear Lube is a multi-purpose, thermally stable and durable gear lubricant recommended for enclosed industrial and automotive gear drives where extreme pressure protection is needed from high speed, adverse conditions, high film strength, tackiness and excellent water separation properties. The addition of molybdenum disulfide to the base oil helps extend the efficiency and life of the equipment.
