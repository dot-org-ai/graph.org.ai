Used heavy rail in good enough condition to be re-laid. Relay rail is often used for industrial sidings and spur tracks, where the slower speed and infrequent traffic do not warranty laying new rail. Relay rail is graded and classified according to the type and number of flaws, and the amount of wear established.
