# Runway sweeper, self-propelled

The sweeper acts as a self-propelled vacuum cleaner that is fitted with all the necessary controls, instructions, accessories, and adjustments to enable it to function efficiently. It works on the suction principle i.e. the objects to be picked up are placed in a stream of high-velocity air, enabling them to develop an ‘aerodynamic drag force’ in the direction of the air flow.
