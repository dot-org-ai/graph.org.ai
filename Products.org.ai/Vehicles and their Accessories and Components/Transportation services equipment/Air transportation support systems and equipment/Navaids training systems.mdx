A set of simulators support training through the ATCO student's learning path. The system can be used in classroom training (e.g., for instructor presentations) as well as in self-learning contexts. The system is particularly interesting for remote learning phases, e.g., during refresher phases. E.g., abnormal and emergency situations can be played through.
