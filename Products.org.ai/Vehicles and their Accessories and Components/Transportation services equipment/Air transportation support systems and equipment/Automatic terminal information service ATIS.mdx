Automatic terminal information service, or ATIS, is a continuous broadcast of recorded aeronautical information in busier terminal areas, i.e. airports and their immediate surroundings. ATIS broadcasts contain essential information, such as current weather information, active runways, available approaches, and any other information required by the pilots, such as important Notices to Airmen (NOTAM) which alert aircraft pilots of potential hazards along a flight route or at a location that could affect the safety of the flight.
