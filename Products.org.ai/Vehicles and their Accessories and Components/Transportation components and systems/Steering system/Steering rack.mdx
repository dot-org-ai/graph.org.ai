**UNSPSC Code**: 25174201
**Class**: [Steering system](Steering system.mdx)
**Family**: [Transportation components and systems](../Transportation components and systems.mdx)
**Segment**: [Vehicles and their Accessories and Components](../../Vehicles and their Accessories and Components.mdx)

Device composed of a rack enclosed with a steering pinion.  It is connected to the steering wheel through a set of shafts and U-joints.  As the steering wheel is turned, the pinion moves and pushes the steering rack either to the left or right.  The ends of the steering rack are connected to the front wheels so the steering rack inputs and turns them to the left or right as well.
