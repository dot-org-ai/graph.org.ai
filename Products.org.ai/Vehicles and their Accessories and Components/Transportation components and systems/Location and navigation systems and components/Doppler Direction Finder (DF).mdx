Doppler radio direction finding, or Doppler DF for short, is a radio direction finding method that generates accurate bearing information with a minimum of electronics. It is best suited to VHF and UHF frequencies, and takes only a short time to indicate a direction. This makes it suitable for measuring the location of the vast majority of commercial, amateur and automated broadcasts, and Doppler DF is one of the most widely used direction finding techniques. Other direction finding techniques are generally used only for fleeting signals, or longer or shorter wavelengths.
