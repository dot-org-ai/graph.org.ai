The NDB is basically a simple transmitter radiating an omnidirectional signal which is modulated at intervals with the identification code. The basic signal is known as a carrier and is radiated at the frequency specified for the particular aid. The identification code is a 400 or 1020 cycle note superimposed on the carrier. Some installations include voice modulation to provide landing information and some others, for remote monitoring purposes, have one or two pips between idents.
