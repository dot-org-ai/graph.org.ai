# Differential global positioning system - ground station

**UNSPSC Code**: 25173135
**Class**: [Location and navigation systems and components](Location and navigation systems and components.mdx)

The underlying premise of differential GPS (DGPS) requires that a GPS receiver, known as the base station, be set up on a precisely known location. The base station receiver calculates its position based on satellite signals and compares this location to the known location.
