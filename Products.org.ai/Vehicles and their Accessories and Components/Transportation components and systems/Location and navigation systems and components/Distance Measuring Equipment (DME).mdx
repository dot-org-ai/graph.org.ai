Distance measuring equipment (DME) is a system requiring both aircraft-installed and ground-based equipment, with the latter normally co-located with a VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR) or, sometimes, an instrument landing system (ILS). It provides the pilot with the slant-range distance to the DME transmitter.
