# Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS)

**UNSPSC Code**: 25173109
**Class**: [Location and navigation systems and components](Location and navigation systems and components.mdx)
**Family**: [Transportation components and systems](../Transportation components and systems.mdx)
**Segment**: [Vehicles and their Accessories and Components](../../Vehicles and their Accessories and Components.mdx)

The local-area augmentation system (LAAS) is an all-weather aircraft landing system based on real-time differential correction of the GPS signal. A Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) is an enhancement to the Global Positioning System (GPS) which provides improved location accuracy, in the range of operations of each system, from the 15-meter nominal GPS accuracy to about 1/3 cm in case of the best implementations.
