Apron covers can be used wherever space constrictions do not allow the use of telescopic covers. They are positioned directly on the guideway and can be loosely hung on, screwed, bolted, or also wound onto the end of the path without any particular guiding. It is a metal frame which is welded to the body and holds the struts.
