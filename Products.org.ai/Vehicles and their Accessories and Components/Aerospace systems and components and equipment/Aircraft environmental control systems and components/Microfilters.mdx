Microfilters are used as pre-filters for the efficient and continuous removal of solids such as rust, sand and other particulates from aviation fuels. Aviation microfilters are used in refineries, terminals and airport depots, primarily as pre-filters to lengthen the service life of downstream coalescer elements in filter/water separators.
