# Defueling connections

**UNSPSC Code**: 25202411
**Class**: [Aircraft fuel tanks and systems](Aircraft fuel tanks and systems.mdx)
**Family**: [Aerospace systems and components and equipment](../Aerospace systems and components and equipment.mdx)
**Segment**: [Vehicles and their Accessories and Components](../../Vehicles and their Accessories and Components.mdx)

Defueling the aircraft may be accomplished by either suction, pumping or a combination of both. Suction defueling is accomplished through the pressure fueling adapter and does not result in a completely empty fuel tank. Pumping is accomplished through the drain valves located in each of the upper main wheel wells.
