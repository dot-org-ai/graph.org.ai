Offshore loading systems are specialized equipment and infrastructure used for the transfer of oil, gas, and other fluids between offshore production facilities and tankers or other vessels. Offshore loading systems are typically installed in locations where the water depth is too deep for fixed platforms or when the production site is located far from the shore. There are different types of offshore loading systems, including FPSOs, FSOs, CALM buoys, loading towers and fixed platforms. The transfer of oil from these facilities to a waiting tanker or shuttle tanker is carried out via a offloading system and a bow-loading system.
