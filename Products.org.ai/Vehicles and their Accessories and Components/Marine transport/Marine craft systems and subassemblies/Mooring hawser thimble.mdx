Hawser is a nautical term for a thick cable or rope used in mooring or towing a ship. A hawser passes through a hawsehole, also known as a cat hole, located on the hawse. The cast-steel Heavy Duty Hawser Thimble is designed for use with wire rope or high-performance synthetic fiber ropes such as AmSteel®-Blue, Force-8, and DPX™-75. The galvanized thimble provides smooth and even grooves, maximum strength in critical areas, and the proper bending radius for the rope. contains rolls and shackles.
