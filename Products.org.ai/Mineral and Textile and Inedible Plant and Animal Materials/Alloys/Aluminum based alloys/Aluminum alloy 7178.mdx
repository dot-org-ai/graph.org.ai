# Aluminum alloy 7178

**UNSPSC Code**: 11172001
**Class**: [Aluminum based alloys](Aluminum based alloys.mdx)
**Family**: [Alloys](../Alloys.mdx)
**Segment**: [Mineral and Textile and Inedible Plant and Animal Materials](../../Mineral and Textile and Inedible Plant and Animal Materials.mdx)

Aluminum based alloy with the following main characteristics: Zn 6,30 to 7,30 percent, Mg 2,40 to 3,10 percent, Cu 1,60 to 2,40 percent, Fe 1,00 percent, balance equals Al + minor metallurgical pollutions. Alloy 7178 is a high strength alloy with magnesium and copper as the major alloying elements. It is heat treatable and develops improved mechanical properties from precipitation hardening.
