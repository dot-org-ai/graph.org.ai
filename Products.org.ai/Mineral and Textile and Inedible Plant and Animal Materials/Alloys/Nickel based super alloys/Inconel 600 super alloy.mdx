# Inconel 600 super alloy

**UNSPSC Code**: 11171801
**Class**: [Nickel based super alloys](Nickel based super alloys.mdx)
**Family**: [Alloys](../Alloys.mdx)
**Segment**: [Mineral and Textile and Inedible Plant and Animal Materials](../../Mineral and Textile and Inedible Plant and Animal Materials.mdx)

Nickel-based alloy, with the following main characteristics: Ni 72,00 % min., Cr 14,00 to 17,00 %, Fe 6,00 to 10,00 %, balance = minor metallurgical pollutions. This alloy is suitable for high temperature applications where corrosion resistance is important. Frequently used for heat-treating baskets.
