# Plywood

**UNSPSC Code**: 11122001
**Class**: [Engineered wood products](Engineered wood products.mdx)
**Family**: [Non edible plant and forestry products](../Non edible plant and forestry products.mdx)

A type of engineered board made from thin sheets of wood, called plies or wood veneers. The layers are glued together, each with its grain at right angles to adjacent layers for greater strength. There are usually an odd number of plies, as the symmetry makes the board less prone to warping and the grain on the outside surfaces runs in the same direction. The plies are bonded under heat and pressure with strong adhesives making plywood a type of composite material.
