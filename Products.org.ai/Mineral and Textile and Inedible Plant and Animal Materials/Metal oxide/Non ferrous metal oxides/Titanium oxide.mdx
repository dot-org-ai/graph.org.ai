# Titanium oxide

**UNSPSC Code**: 11181502
**Class**: [Non ferrous metal oxides](Non ferrous metal oxides.mdx)
**Family**: [Metal oxide](../Metal oxide.mdx)
**Segment**: [Mineral and Textile and Inedible Plant and Animal Materials](../../Mineral and Textile and Inedible Plant and Animal Materials.mdx)

As a pigment of high refringence, titanium dioxide is the most widely used white pigment because of its brightness and very high refractive index (n=2.4), in which it is surpassed only by a few other materials. When deposited as a thin film, its refractive index and colour make it an excellent reflective optical coating for dielectric mirrors and some gemstones
