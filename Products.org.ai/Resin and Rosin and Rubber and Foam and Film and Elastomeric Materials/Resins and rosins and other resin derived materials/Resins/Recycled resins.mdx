# Recycled resins

**UNSPSC Code**: 13111063
**Class**: [Resins](Resins.mdx)
**Family**: [Resins and rosins and other resin derived materials](../Resins and rosins and other resin derived materials.mdx)
**Segment**: [Resin and Rosin and Rubber and Foam and Film and Elastomeric Materials](../../Resin and Rosin and Rubber and Foam and Film and Elastomeric Materials.mdx)

Resins generated as a result of recycling should be added. An example would be resin produced from the process of chopping up plastic bottles, melting the chips of resin down and repelletizing.
