This is a semi solid mixture of hydrocarbons originally promoted as a topical ointment for its healing properties. Its folkloric medicinal value as a cure all has since been limited by better scientific understanding of appropriate and inappropriate uses. However, it is recognized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an approved over the counter skin protectant and remains widely used in cosmetic skin care.
