Derivative oil from Cinnamonum verum. The cinnamon is distinguished by its small white flowers, bright green leaves, and purple oval berries. The cinnamon leaf essential oil can be used as an additive in soaps and as a flavoring. When used in aromatherapy, diffused or applied topically (we recommend diluting it with softer essential oil or in your favorite cream, lotion or shampoo), it can have beneficial effects for health.
