Knit incontinence pants support people with incontinence issues to allow them the option of being discreet with their pads or incontinence liners. The knit pants are used with either liners or pads to help hold them in place due to the close fit; the ability to absorb minor leakage is an additional benefit. Please products are used mostly in hospitals and long-term care settings.
