Hydrogen site equipment refers to the various types of equipment and infrastructure required for the production, storage, and distribution of hydrogen at a specific site or facility. Hydrogen production or generation is the family of industrial methods for generating hydrogen gas. Majority of hydrogen (∼95%) is produced from fossil fuels by steam reforming of natural gas and other light hydrocarbons, partial oxidation of heavier hydrocarbons, and coal gasification.
