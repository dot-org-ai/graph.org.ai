All-electric vehicles also referred to as battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine. The vehicle uses a large traction battery pack to power the electric motor and must be plugged in to a wall outlet or charging equipment, also called electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE).An electric powered car has three primary components. These are the electric engine, motor controller, and battery. Electric vehicle supply equipment supplies electricity to an electric vehicle Commonly called charging stations or charging docks, they provide electric power to the vehicle and use that to recharge the vehicle's batteries. EVSE systems include the electrical conductors, related equipment, software, and communications protocols that deliver energy efficiently and safely to the vehicle.
