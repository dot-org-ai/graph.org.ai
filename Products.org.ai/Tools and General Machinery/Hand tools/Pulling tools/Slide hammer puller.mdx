A tool that attaches to an object needing to be pulled and transmits an impact force to the object without striking the object itself.  Slide hammers typically consist of a long metal shaft with an attachment point at one end, a heavy weight that can slide along the shaft, and a stop for the weight to impact on the end opposite the attachment point.[
