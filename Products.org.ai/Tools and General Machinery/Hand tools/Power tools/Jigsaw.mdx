A tool used for cutting arbitrary curves, such as stenciled designs or other custom shapes, into a piece of wood or similar material.It is usually used in a more artistic fashion than other saws, which only cut in straight lines and exist mainly to cut pieces of wood to length for building structures.In this way, it is similar to the rasp and the chisel.
