A small electric or pedal operated saw useful for cutting intricate curves where a jigsaw or coping saw is not appropriate.It is capable of creating curves with edges. It is somewhat similar to a band saw, but unlike band saws, in which the saw blade is a continuous loop, scroll saws use saw blades similar to those used by coping saws and operate through a quick reciprocating up and down motion.
