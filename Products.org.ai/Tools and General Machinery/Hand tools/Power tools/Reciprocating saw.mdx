# Reciprocating saw

**UNSPSC Code**: 27112747
**Class**: [Power tools](Power tools.mdx)
**Family**: [Hand tools](../Hand tools.mdx)
**Segment**: [Tools and General Machinery](../../Tools and General Machinery.mdx)

A type of saw in which the cutting action is achieved through a push and pull reciprocating motion of the blade. The typical style of this saw has a foot at the base of the blade, also similar to a jigsaw. The user rests this foot against the surface being cut so that the tendency of the blade to push away from or pull towards the cut as the blade travels through its cycle can be countered.
