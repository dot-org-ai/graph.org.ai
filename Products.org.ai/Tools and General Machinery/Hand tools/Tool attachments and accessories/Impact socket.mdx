# Impact socket

**UNSPSC Code**: 27112828
**Class**: [Tool attachments and accessories](Tool attachments and accessories.mdx)
**Family**: [Hand tools](../Hand tools.mdx)

A tool very similar to a regular socket but they are rather used with a power or pneumatic tool instead a manual wrench because of its major resistance to the effort.
