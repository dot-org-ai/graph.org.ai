# Bow saw

**UNSPSC Code**: 27111550
**Class**: [Cutting and crimping and punching tools](Cutting and crimping and punching tools.mdx)
**Family**: [Hand tools](../Hand tools.mdx)
**Segment**: [Tools and General Machinery](../../Tools and General Machinery.mdx)

A type of saw considered by many to be the most satisfactory saw for cutting shapes since the narrow blade negotiates curves easily, and is held in tension.Both the handle and knob (at the other end of the blade) can be turned so that a cut can be made more or less parallel to the required cut.
