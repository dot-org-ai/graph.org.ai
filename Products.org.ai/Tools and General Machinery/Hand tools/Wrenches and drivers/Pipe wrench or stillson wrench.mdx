# Pipe wrench or stillson wrench

**UNSPSC Code**: 27111749
**Class**: [Wrenches and drivers](Wrenches and drivers.mdx)
**Family**: [Hand tools](../Hand tools.mdx)
**Segment**: [Tools and General Machinery](../../Tools and General Machinery.mdx)

An adjustable wrench used for turning soft iron pipes and fittings with a rounded surface. The design of the adjustable jaw allows it to rock in the frame, such that any forward pressure on the handle tends to pull the jaws tighter together.
