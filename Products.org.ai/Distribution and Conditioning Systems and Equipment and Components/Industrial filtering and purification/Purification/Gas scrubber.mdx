A gas scrubber is to eliminate harmful particulates and liquid hydrocarbons from natural gas. A natural gas scrubber system works by using particle filters, coalescers, mesh pads, and other devices to remove pollutants from the gas stream. This type of gas scrubbing is the preferred way to ensure that natural gas is clean and dry for industrial use.
