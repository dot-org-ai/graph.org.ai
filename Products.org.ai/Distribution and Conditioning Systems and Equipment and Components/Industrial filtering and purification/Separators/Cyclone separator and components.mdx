# Cyclone separator and components

**UNSPSC Code**: 40161708
**Class**: [Separators](Separators.mdx)
**Family**: [Industrial filtering and purification](../Industrial filtering and purification.mdx)
**Segment**: [Distribution and Conditioning Systems and Equipment and Components](../../Distribution and Conditioning Systems and Equipment and Components.mdx)

A cyclone separator is an economical device for removing particulate solids from a fluid system. The induced centrifugal force is tangentially imparted on the wall of the cyclone cylinder. This force, with the density difference between the fluid and solid, increases the relative settling velocity.
