# Booster pump

**UNSPSC Code**: 40151566
**Class**: [Pumps](Pumps.mdx)
**Family**: [Industrial pumps and compressors](../Industrial pumps and compressors.mdx)
**Segment**: [Distribution and Conditioning Systems and Equipment and Components](../../Distribution and Conditioning Systems and Equipment and Components.mdx)

The booster pump is a positive displacement pump which operates by pulling air through a pair of meshing lobes not unlike a set of stretched gears. Air is trapped in pockets surrounding the lobes and carried from the intake side to the exhaust. The supercharger is driven directly from the engine's crankshaft via a belt or, in a two-stroke diesel engine, by spur gears.
