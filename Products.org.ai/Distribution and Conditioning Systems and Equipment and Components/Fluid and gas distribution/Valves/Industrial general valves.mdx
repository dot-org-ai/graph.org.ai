They are an essential component in many industrial processes and applications, including oil and gas, chemical, water and wastewater treatment, and power generation.General valves can be classified based on their operating mechanisms, such as manual, electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic.Valves are for starting or stopping flow, regulating or throttling flow, preventing back flow or relieving and regulating pressure in fluid or gaseous handling applications.
