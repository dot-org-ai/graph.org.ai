# Block and bleed valve

**UNSPSC Code**: 40141658
**Class**: [Valves](Valves.mdx)
**Family**: [Fluid and gas distribution](../Fluid and gas distribution.mdx)
**Segment**: [Distribution and Conditioning Systems and Equipment and Components](../../Distribution and Conditioning Systems and Equipment and Components.mdx)

A heavy duty mainline valve made to hold bubble tight against high pressure. The valve is made with a small bleeder line and valve which are tapped into the block valve's bonnet. When the block valve is closed, its effectiveness may be checked by opening the bleeder valve for evidence of any leakage from the upstream or high-pressure side.
