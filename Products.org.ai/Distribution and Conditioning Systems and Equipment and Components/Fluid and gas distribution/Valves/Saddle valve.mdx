# Saddle valve

**UNSPSC Code**: 40141642
**Class**: [Valves](Valves.mdx)
**Family**: [Fluid and gas distribution](../Fluid and gas distribution.mdx)
**Segment**: [Distribution and Conditioning Systems and Equipment and Components](../../Distribution and Conditioning Systems and Equipment and Components.mdx)

A saddle valve is a valve used to supply liquid where a low volume, low pressure stream is required. The name is derived from the fact that it is mounted in such a way that it "saddles" the line, mounting it from both sides.
