# Toilet flush valve

**UNSPSC Code**: 40141640
**Class**: [Valves](Valves.mdx)
**Family**: [Fluid and gas distribution](../Fluid and gas distribution.mdx)
**Segment**: [Distribution and Conditioning Systems and Equipment and Components](../../Distribution and Conditioning Systems and Equipment and Components.mdx)

A buoyant plastic device that covers the outlet in the bottom of the toilet tank and is held in place by water pressure. It is activated by a lever which lifts the device from the outlet and floats clear allowing the tank to empty quickly into the bowl. As the water level drops, the device descends back to the bottom of the tank and covers the outlet pipe again.
