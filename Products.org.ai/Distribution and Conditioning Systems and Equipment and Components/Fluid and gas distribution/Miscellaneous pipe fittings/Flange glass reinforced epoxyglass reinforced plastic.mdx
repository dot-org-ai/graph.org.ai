Flanges made of glass-reinforced epoxy (GRE) or glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) are types of composite flanges that are composed of a thermosetting resin reinforced with glass fibers. These materials offer a high strength-to-weight ratio, excellent corrosion resistance, and are typically low-cost alternatives to traditional metallic flanges.
