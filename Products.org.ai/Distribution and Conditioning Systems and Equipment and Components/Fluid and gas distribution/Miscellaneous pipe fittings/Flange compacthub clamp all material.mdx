A compact flange or hub clamp is a type of flange that uses a different design from traditional flanges to create a stronger and more reliable connection between two pipes or other equipment. Instead of using bolts and nuts to hold the flange in place, a compact flange or hub clamp relies on a pre-loaded tapered plug that is compressed between the flange faces to create a leak-proof seal.Pipe compact flange /hub clamp made of carbon steel, high yield carbon steel, alloy steel, stainless steel, duplex and super duplex, and various nickel alloy grades such as Inconel, Incoloy, Hastelloy, and Monel etc.
