Strainers, in general, are used for filtration purposes. They help separate the liquid from the solid particles, giving you pure results. The infused liquid is passed through a removable screen which helps collect particles. The same is the reason why strainers are used in pipelines. The screen also collects particles of size 0.001 inches to ensure no impurities are passed. The filters of the strainers are usually produced using fibrous substances. This kind of substance helps capture the debris at several spots throughout. This results in clogging the filter component, which needs to be changed often. There are different types of strainers in piping, Y-Type Strainers, Basket Type Strainers, Temporary Strainers, Twin Strainers or Duplex Strainers, Some Special Strainer Types etc.
