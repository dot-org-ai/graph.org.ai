An ejector is a device used to suck the gas or vapor from the desired vessel or system. An ejector is similar to an of vacuum pump or compressor. The major difference between the ejector and the vacuum pump or compressor is it had no moving parts. Hence it is relatively low-cost and easy to operate and maintenance free equipment. The industrial steam ejector (also called the "steam jet ejector", "steam aspirator", or "evactor") uses steam as a working fluid and multistage systems can produce very high vacuums. Due to the lack of delicate moving parts and the flow of steam providing somewhat of cleaning action, steam ejectors can handle gas flows containing liquids, dust, or even solid particles that would damage or clog many other vacuum pumps. Ejectors made entirely from specialized materials such as PTFE or graphite have allowed usage of extremely corrosive gasses, since steam ejectors have no moving parts, they can be constructed in their entirety from almost any material that has sufficient durability. An air ejector is commonly called an air ejector, Venturi pump, or vacuum ejector. This ejector is similar in operation to the steam ejector but uses high-pressure air as the working fluid. Multistage air ejectors can be used, but since air cannot easily be condensed at room temperature, an air ejector is usually limited to two stages as each subsequent stage would have to be significantly larger than the last. These are commonly used in pneumatic handling equipment when a small vacuum is required to pick up objects since compressed air is often already present to power other parts of the equipment. Air ejectors used to suction liquids directly will produce a fine mist of droplets, this is how airbrushes and many other spraying systems operate, but when a spray is not required it is typically an undesirable effect that limits the applications to gas suction.
