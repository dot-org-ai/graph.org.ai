A bicycle-like watercraft.  Power is collected from the rider via a crank with pedals, as on a bicycle, and delivered to the water or the air via a propeller.  Seating may be upright or recumbent, and multiple riders may be accommodated in tandem or side-by-side. Buoyancy is provided by two or more pontoons or a single surfboard, and some have hydrofoils that can lift the flotation devices out of the water
