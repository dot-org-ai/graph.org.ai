# Open top freight container

**UNSPSC Code**: 24112802
**Class**: [Freight containers](Freight containers.mdx)
**Family**: [Containers and storage](../Containers and storage.mdx)
**Segment**: [Material Handling and Conditioning and Storage Machinery and their Accessories and Supplies](../../Material Handling and Conditioning and Storage Machinery and their Accessories and Supplies.mdx)

An open top container has an open top covered by a tarpaulin instead of a solid roof. This enables oversized (i.e. door opening) cargo such as timber and scrap metal to be loaded from the top. These containers normally have end doors to give flexibility to loading and discharging operations.
