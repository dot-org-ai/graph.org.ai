GRP, or glass-reinforced plastic, is composed of strands of glass. The glass fibers are very fine, and they are woven to form a flexible fabric. When layered with resin and catalyst and allowed to cure, the resulting material is extremely strong and lightweight.t has a high strength-to-weight ratio. FRP (Fiberglass Reinforced Plastics, also known as GRP, or Glass Reinforced Plastics) is a modern composite material of construction for chemical plant equipment like tanks and vessels. Chemical equipment that ranges in size from less than a meter to 20 meters is fabricated using FRP as a material of construction.
