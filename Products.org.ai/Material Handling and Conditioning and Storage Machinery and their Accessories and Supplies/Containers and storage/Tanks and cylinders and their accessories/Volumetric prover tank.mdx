A tank used for calibration of large-volume liquid flow meters. Prover tanks are generally mounted on mobile trailer units that can be pulled by truck from one location to another. The tanks are made of either stainless steel or carbon steel, and are designed and built with little or no dimensional tolerances. A volumetric proving tank is a reference standard used for proving meters under test. The tank is initially calibrated by an approved testing authority using a primary reference measuring instrument traceable to national standards, to an accuracy of ±0,05% or better.
