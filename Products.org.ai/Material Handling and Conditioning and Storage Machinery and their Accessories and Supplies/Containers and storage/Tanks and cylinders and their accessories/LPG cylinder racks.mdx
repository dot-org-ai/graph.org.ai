Gas cylinders both empty and full must be stored vertically and be secured in stands in the upright position and secure with an insulated chain or non-conductive belt to protect cylinders from falling or becoming damaged. This is necessary to prevent them toppling over and getting damaged, leading to potentially harmful gas leaks.
