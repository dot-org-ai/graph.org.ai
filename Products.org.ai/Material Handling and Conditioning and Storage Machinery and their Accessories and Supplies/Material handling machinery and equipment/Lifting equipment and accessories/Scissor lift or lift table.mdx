A device that employs a scissors mechanism to raise or lower materials in such a way as to provide ergonomic positioning for operators. Lift tables come in a vast array of configurations and can be built to suit various highly specialized industrial processes. The most common lift table design incorporates hydraulic cylinders and an electrical motor to actuate the scissor lifting mechanism. Lift tables can also be driven by pneumatic sources or by foot pump when the load is not excessively heavy. Lift tables can be mounted in a pit for floor-level loading, can include rotating tops, tilting mechanisms, and other various features to ensure operator safety and ease of use.
