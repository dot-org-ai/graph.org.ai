This a type of valve used in controlling flow rate of granular bulk raw materials, mostly fitted at the bottom of bunkers/silos. It consists of a box-like frame made of a mild steel channel through which mild steel control rods are inserted from both sides. Rod removal increases material flow; rod insertion decreases material flow.
