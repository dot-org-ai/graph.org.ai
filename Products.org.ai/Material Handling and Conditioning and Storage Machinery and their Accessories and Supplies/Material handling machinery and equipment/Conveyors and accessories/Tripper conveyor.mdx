A pulley-driven type of conveyor belt used in construction, mining, and other large-scale earth-moving businesses. They are also known as tiered or stepped conveyers and are designed to convey materials uphill. In order to keep these materials from sliding back down the conveyor, tall ridges or flaps are affixed laterally to the face of the conveyor belts.
