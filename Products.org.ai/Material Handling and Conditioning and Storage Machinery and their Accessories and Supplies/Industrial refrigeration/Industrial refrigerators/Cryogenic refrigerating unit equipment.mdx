Cryogenic cooling uses refrigerants, such as liquid nitrogen or solid carbon dioxide, directly. Cryogenic freezing is often treated as a specific type of freezing method on its own, however, it is essentially an immersion/spray system, depending on how the cryogen is utilized. Cryogenic equipment includes cryogenic storage racks and boxes, cryogenic refrigerators, temperature controllers, cryogenics accessories and cryogenic tanks. A cryogenic tank or Dewar is used to store cryogenic gases such as liquid oxygen, nitrogen, argon, carbon dioxide, and methane in bulk quantities.
