# Wind tunnel

**UNSPSC Code**: 41103326
**Class**: [Fluid mechanics equipment](Fluid mechanics equipment.mdx)
**Family**: [Laboratory and scientific equipment](../Laboratory and scientific equipment.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

Equipment that is utilized to observe and study the phenomenon of air and it proves the theories of hydrodynamics in actual experiment and to measure several types of phenomenon and force working on the object in air. The air flow is artificially generated to find out how the object (model) to be experimented moves in the air in this tunnel-shaped experiment device.
