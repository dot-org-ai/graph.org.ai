# Floating body stability measurement apparatus

**UNSPSC Code**: 41103321
**Class**: [Fluid mechanics equipment](Fluid mechanics equipment.mdx)
**Family**: [Laboratory and scientific equipment](../Laboratory and scientific equipment.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

Equipment that measures the weight center of the gravity in floating body including stability, neutral, unstable and others for the object floating on the liquid surface. Floating pontoon is launched on the water tank to measure the center of floating body, and it measures the change of metacenter height following the slope of the metacenter and the floating body from metacenter height to experiment the stability of the floating body.
