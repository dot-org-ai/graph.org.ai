# Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system

**UNSPSC Code**: 41104933
**Class**: [Laboratory filtering equipment and supplies](Laboratory filtering equipment and supplies.mdx)
**Family**: [Laboratory and scientific equipment](../Laboratory and scientific equipment.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

Designed for the sensitive, reproducible, endpoint detection and analysis of RNA molecules by RT–PCR. Using this convenient one-step formulation, you can perform both cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification in a single tube using gene-specific primers, and target RNAs from either total RNA or mRNA. The system uses a mixture of SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase and Platinum™ Taq DNA Polymerase in an optimized reaction buffer, and it can detect a wide range of RNA targets, from 200 bp to 4.5 kb. The amount of starting material can range from 0.01 pg to 1 μg of total RNA.
