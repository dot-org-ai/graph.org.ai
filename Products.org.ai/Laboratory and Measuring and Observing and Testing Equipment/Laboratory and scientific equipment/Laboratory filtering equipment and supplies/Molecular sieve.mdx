# Molecular sieve

**UNSPSC Code**: 41104930
**Class**: [Laboratory filtering equipment and supplies](Laboratory filtering equipment and supplies.mdx)
**Family**: [Laboratory and scientific equipment](../Laboratory and scientific equipment.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

A material device containing tiny pores of a precise and uniform size that is used as an adsorbent for gases and liquids.Molecules small enough to pass through the pores are adsorbed while larger molecules are not. It differs from a common filter in that it operates on a molecular level.
