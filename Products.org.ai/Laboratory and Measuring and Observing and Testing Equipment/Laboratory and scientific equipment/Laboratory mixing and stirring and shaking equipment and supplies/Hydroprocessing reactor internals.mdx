# Hydroprocessing reactor internals

**UNSPSC Code**: 41103820
**Class**: [Laboratory mixing and stirring and shaking equipment and supplies](Laboratory mixing and stirring and shaking equipment and supplies.mdx)
**Family**: [Laboratory and scientific equipment](../Laboratory and scientific equipment.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

The performance of hydro processing reactors is determined not only by the catalyst loaded but also by the performance of their internals. Shell Catalysts & Technologies’ reactor internals technology uniformly distributes liquid and gas, minimizes thermal maldistribution, and maximizes catalyst volume and utilization.
