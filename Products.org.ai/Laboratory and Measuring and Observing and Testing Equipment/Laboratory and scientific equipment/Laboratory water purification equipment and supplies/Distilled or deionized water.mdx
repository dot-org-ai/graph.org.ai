Both distilled and deionized water is water that has been purified. Distilled water is water that has had all its impurities removed by boiling. Deionized water is water that lacks ions, causing the waters resistivity to increase. It is similar to distilled water and is useful for scientific experiments. It also can be used for a short time as a high voltage dielectric in some pulsed power applications.
