It is a type of fractional distillation that is specially undertaken when classifying the solution that contains two or more kinds of volatile ingredient, such as alcohol, perfume, petroleum and the like, for each ingredient. The fraction is the measurement of substance capacity lessened within the scope of regulated temperature and this device enables to measure such classification and quantity.
