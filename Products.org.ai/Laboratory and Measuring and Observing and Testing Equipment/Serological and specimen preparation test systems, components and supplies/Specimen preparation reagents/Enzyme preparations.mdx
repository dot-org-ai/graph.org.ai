In this classification Enzyme preparations are products that are used in the histopathology laboratory for the following purposes: to disaggregate tissues and cells already in established cultures for preparation into subsequent cultures (e.g., trypsin); to disaggregate fluid specimens for cytological examination (e.g., papain for gastric lavage or trypsin for sputum liquefaction); to aid in the selective staining of tissue specimens (e.g., diastase for glycogen determination). US FDA regulates Enzyme preparations under 21 CFR 864.4400 and under FDA product code IBC.
