# Fully automated short-term incubation cycle antimicrobial susceptibility system

**UNSPSC Code**: 41171503
**Class**: [Diagnostic devices](Diagnostic devices.mdx)
**Family**: [Diagnostic and microbiological devices](../Diagnostic and microbiological devices.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

In this classification a fully automated short-term incubation cycle antimicrobial susceptibility system is a device that incorporates concentrations of antimicrobial agents into a system for the purpose of determining in vitro susceptibility of bacterial pathogens isolated from clinical specimens. Test results obtained from short-term (less than 16 hours) incubation are used to determine the antimicrobial agent of choice to treat bacterial diseases US FDA regulates Fully automated short-term incubation cycle antimicrobial susceptibility system under 21 CFR 866.1645 and under FDA product code LON.
