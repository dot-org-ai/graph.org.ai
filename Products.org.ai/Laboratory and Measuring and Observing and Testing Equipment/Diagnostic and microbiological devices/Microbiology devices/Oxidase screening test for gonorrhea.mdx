# Oxidase screening test for gonorrhea

**UNSPSC Code**: 41171612
**Class**: [Microbiology devices](Microbiology devices.mdx)
**Family**: [Diagnostic and microbiological devices](../Diagnostic and microbiological devices.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

In this classification, a Oxidase screening test for gonorrhea connotes an in vitro device that consists of the articles intended to identify by chemical reaction, cytochrome oxidase, an oxidizing enzyme that is associated with certain bacteria including Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Because it is unlikely that cytochrome oxidase-positive organisms other than Neisseria gonorrhoeae are present in the urethral discharge of males, the identification of cytochrome oxidase with this device indicates presumptive infection of the patient with the causative agent of gonorrhea. US FDA regulates Oxidase screening test for gonorrhea under 21 CFR 866.2420 and under FDA product code LGA.
