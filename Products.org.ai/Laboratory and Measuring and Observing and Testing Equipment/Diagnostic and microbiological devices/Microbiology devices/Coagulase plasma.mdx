# Coagulase plasma

**UNSPSC Code**: 41171602
**Class**: [Microbiology devices](Microbiology devices.mdx)
**Family**: [Diagnostic and microbiological devices](../Diagnostic and microbiological devices.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

In this classification, a Coagulase plasma connotes a device used to create staphylothrombin, which enables the enzyme protease to convert fibrinogen, a plasma protein produced by the liver, to fibrin. This results in clotting of the blood. US FDA regulates Coagulase plasma under 21 CFR 866.2160 and under FDA product code JTL.
