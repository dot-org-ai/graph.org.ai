# Plasma oncometer for clinical use

**UNSPSC Code**: 41151622
**Class**: [Clinical laboratory instruments](Clinical laboratory instruments.mdx)
**Family**: [Clinical laboratory and toxicology testing systems, components, and supplies](../Clinical laboratory and toxicology testing systems, components, and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

In this classification a plasma oncometer for clinical use is a device intended to measure plasma oncotic pressure, which is that portion of the total plasma osmotic pressure contributed by protein and other molecules too large to pass through a specified semipermeable membrane. Because variations in plasma oncotic pressure are indications of certain disorders, measurements of the variations are useful in the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders US FDA regulates Plasma oncometer for clinical use under 21 CFR 862.2720 and under FDA product code JJK.
