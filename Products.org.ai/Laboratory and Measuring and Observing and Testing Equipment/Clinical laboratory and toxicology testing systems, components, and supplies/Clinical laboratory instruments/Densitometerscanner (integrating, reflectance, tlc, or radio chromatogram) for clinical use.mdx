# Densitometer/scanner (integrating, reflectance, tlc, or radio chromatogram) for clinical use

**UNSPSC Code**: 41151614
**Class**: [Clinical laboratory instruments](Clinical laboratory instruments.mdx)
**Family**: [Clinical laboratory and toxicology testing systems, components, and supplies](../Clinical laboratory and toxicology testing systems, components, and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

In this classification a densitometer/scanner (integrating, reflectance, thin-layer chromatography, or radio chromatogram) for clinical use is device intended to measure the concentration of a substance on the surface of a film or other support media by either a photocell measurement of the light transmission through a given area of the medium or, in the case of the radio chromatogram scanner, by measurement of the distribution of a specific radio-active element on a radio chromatogram US FDA regulates Densitometer/scanner (integrating, reflectance, tlc, or radio chromatogram) for clinical use under 21 CFR 862.2400 and under FDA product code JQT.
