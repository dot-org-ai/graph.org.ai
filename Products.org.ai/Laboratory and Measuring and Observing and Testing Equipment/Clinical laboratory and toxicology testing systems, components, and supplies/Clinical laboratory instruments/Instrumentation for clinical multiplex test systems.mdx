# Instrumentation for clinical multiplex test systems

**UNSPSC Code**: 41151619
**Class**: [Clinical laboratory instruments](Clinical laboratory instruments.mdx)
**Family**: [Clinical laboratory and toxicology testing systems, components, and supplies](../Clinical laboratory and toxicology testing systems, components, and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

In this classification Instrumentation for clinical multiplex test systems is a device intended to measure and sort multiple signals generated by an assay from a clinical sample. This instrumentation is used with a specific assay to measure multiple similar analytes that establish a single indicator to aid in diagnosis. Such instrumentation may be compatible with more than one specific assay. The device includes a signal reader unit, and may also integrate reagent handling, hybridization, washing, dedicated instrument control, and other hardware components, as well as raw data storage mechanisms, data acquisition software, and software to process detected signals US FDA regulates Instrumentation for clinical multiplex test systems under 21 CFR 862.2570 and under FDA product code NSU.
