# Atomic absorption spectrophotometer for clinical use

**UNSPSC Code**: 41151626
**Class**: [Clinical laboratory instruments](Clinical laboratory instruments.mdx)
**Family**: [Clinical laboratory and toxicology testing systems, components, and supplies](../Clinical laboratory and toxicology testing systems, components, and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

In this classification an atomic absorption spectrophotometer for clinical use is a device intended to identify and measure elements and metals (e.g., lead and mercury) in human specimens. The metal elements are identified according to the wavelength and intensity of the light that is absorbed when the specimen is converted to the atomic vapor phase US FDA regulates Atomic absorption spectrophotometer for clinical use under 21 CFR 862.2850 and under FDA product code JXR.
