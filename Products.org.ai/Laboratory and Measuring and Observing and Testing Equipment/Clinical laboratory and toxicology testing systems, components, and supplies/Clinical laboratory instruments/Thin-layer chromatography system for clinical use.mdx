# Thin-layer chromatography system for clinical use

**UNSPSC Code**: 41151610
**Class**: [Clinical laboratory instruments](Clinical laboratory instruments.mdx)
**Family**: [Clinical laboratory and toxicology testing systems, components, and supplies](../Clinical laboratory and toxicology testing systems, components, and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

In this classification a thin-layer chromatography (TLC) system for clinical use is a device intended to separate one or more drugs or compounds from a mixture. The mixture of compounds is absorbed onto a stationary phase or thin layer of inert material (e.g., cellulose, alumina, etc.) and eluted off by a moving solvent (moving phase) until equilibrium occurs between the two phases US FDA regulates Thin-layer chromatography system for clinical use under 21 CFR 862.2270 and under FDA product code KZS.
