# Rocket immunoelectrophoresis equipment

**UNSPSC Code**: 41181609
**Class**: [Immunology laboratory equipment and reagents](Immunology laboratory equipment and reagents.mdx)
**Family**: [Immunological testing systems, components, and supplies](../Immunological testing systems, components, and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

In this classification, Rocket immunoelectrophoresis equipment connotes a device used to perform a specific test on proteins by using a procedure called rocket immunoelectrophoresis. In this procedure, an electric current causes the protein in solution to migrate through agar gel containing specific antisera. The protein precipitates with the antisera in a rocket-shaped pattern, giving the name to the device. The height of the peak (or the area under the peak) is proportional to the concentration of the protein. US FDA regulates Rocket immunoelectrophoresis equipment under 21 CFR 866.4830 and under FDA product code JZX.
