# Automated fluorescencein situhybridization (fish) enumeration systems

**UNSPSC Code**: 41181607
**Class**: [Immunology laboratory equipment and reagents](Immunology laboratory equipment and reagents.mdx)
**Family**: [Immunological testing systems, components, and supplies](../Immunological testing systems, components, and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

In this classification, Automated fluorescencein situhybridization (fish) enumeration systems connotes a device that consists of an automated scanning microscope, image analysis system, and customized software applications for FISH assays. This device is intended for in vitro diagnostic use with FISH assays as an aid in the detection, counting and classification of cells based on recognition of cellular color, size, and shape, and in the detection and enumeration of FISH signals in interphase nuclei of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tissue specimens. US FDA regulates Automated fluorescencein situhybridization (fish) enumeration systems under 21 CFR 866.4700 and under FDA product code NTH.
