# Immunofluorometer equipment

**UNSPSC Code**: 41181604
**Class**: [Immunology laboratory equipment and reagents](Immunology laboratory equipment and reagents.mdx)

**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

In this classification, Immunofluorometer equipment connotes a device to measure the fluorescence of fluorochrome-labeled antigen-antibody complexes. The concentration of these complexes may be measured by means of reflected light. A beam of light is passed through a solution in which a fluorochrome has been selectively attached to serum protein antibody molecules in suspension. The amount of light emitted by the fluorochrome label is detected by a photodetector, which converts light energy into electrical energy. The amount of electrical energy registers on a readout system such as a digital voltmeter or a recording chart. This electrical readout is called the fluorescence value and is used to measure the concentration of antigen-antibody complexes. US FDA regulates Immunofluorometer equipment under 21 CFR 866.4520 and under FDA product code JZT.
