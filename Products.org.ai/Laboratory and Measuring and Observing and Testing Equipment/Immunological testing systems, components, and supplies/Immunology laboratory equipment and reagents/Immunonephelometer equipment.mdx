# Immunonephelometer equipment

**UNSPSC Code**: 41181605
**Class**: [Immunology laboratory equipment and reagents](Immunology laboratory equipment and reagents.mdx)

In this classification, Immunonephelometer equipment connotes a device used to that measures light scattering from antigen-antibody complexes. The concentration of these complexes may be measured by means of reflected light. A beam of light passed through a solution is scattered by the particles in suspension. The amount of light is detected by a photodetector, which converts light energy into electrical energy. The amount of electrical energy registers on a readout system such as a digital voltmeter or a recording chart. This electrical readout is called the light-scattering value and is used to measure the concentration of antigen-antibody complexes. This generic type of device includes devices with various kinds of light sources, such as laser equipment. US FDA regulates Immunonephelometer equipment under 21 CFR 866.4540 and under FDA product code JZW.
