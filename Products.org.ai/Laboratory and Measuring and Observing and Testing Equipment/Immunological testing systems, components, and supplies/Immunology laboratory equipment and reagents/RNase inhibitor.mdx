# RNase inhibitor

**UNSPSC Code**: 41181611
**Class**: [Immunology laboratory equipment and reagents](Immunology laboratory equipment and reagents.mdx)
**Family**: [Immunological testing systems, components, and supplies](../Immunological testing systems, components, and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

RNase Inhibitor inhibits the activity of RNases A,B and C by binding them in a noncompetitive mode at a 1:1 ratio. It does not inhibit eukaryotic RNases T1, T2, U1, U2, CL3 as well as prokaryotic RNases I and H. Highlights • Performs under a wide range of reaction conditions • Protects RNA from degradation at temperatures up to 55°C Note DTT provided in the Storage Buffer ensures stability during long term storage, but is not necessary for inhibitor activity. Recommended concentration 1 U/ µL of a reaction mixture. For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.
