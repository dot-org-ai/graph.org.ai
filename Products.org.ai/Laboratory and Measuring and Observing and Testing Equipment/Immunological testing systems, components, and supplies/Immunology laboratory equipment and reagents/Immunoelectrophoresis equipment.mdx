# Immunoelectrophoresis equipment

**UNSPSC Code**: 41181603
**Class**: [Immunology laboratory equipment and reagents](Immunology laboratory equipment and reagents.mdx)

**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

In this classification, Immunoelectrophoresis equipment connotes a device used to Immunoelectrophoresis is a procedure in which a complex protein mixture is placed in an agar gel and the various proteins are separated on the basis of their relative mobilities under the influence of an electric current. The separated proteins are then permitted to diffuse through the agar toward a multispecific antiserum, allowing precipitation and visualization of the separate complexes. US FDA regulates Immunoelectrophoresis equipment under 21 CFR 866.4500 and under FDA product code JZS.
