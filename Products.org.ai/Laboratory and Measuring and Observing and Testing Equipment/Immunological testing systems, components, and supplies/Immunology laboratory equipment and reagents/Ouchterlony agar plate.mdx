# Ouchterlony agar plate

**UNSPSC Code**: 41181606
**Class**: [Immunology laboratory equipment and reagents](Immunology laboratory equipment and reagents.mdx)
**Family**: [Immunological testing systems, components, and supplies](../Immunological testing systems, components, and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

In this classification, Ouchterlony agar plate connotes a device containing an agar gel used to examine antigen-antibody reactions. In immunodiffusion, antibodies and antigens migrate toward each other through gel which originally contained neither of these reagents. As the reagents come in contact with each other, they combine to form a precipitate that is trapped in the gel matrix and is immobilized. US FDA regulates Ouchterlony agar plate under 21 CFR 866.4600 and under FDA product code JZP.
