In this classification, Hematocrit measuring device connotes a system consisting of instruments, tubes, racks, and a sealer and a holder. The device is used to measure the packed red cell volume in blood to determine whether the patient's total red cell volume is normal or abnormal. Abnormal states include anemia (an abnormally low total red cell volume) and erythrocytosis (an abnormally high total red cell mass). The packed red cell volume is produced by centrifuging a given volume of blood. US FDA regulates Hematocrit measuring device under 21 CFR 864.6400 and under FDA product code JPI.
