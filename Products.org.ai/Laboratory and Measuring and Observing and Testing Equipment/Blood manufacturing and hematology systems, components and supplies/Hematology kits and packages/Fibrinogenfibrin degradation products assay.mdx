# Fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products assay

**UNSPSC Code**: 41131710
**Class**: [Hematology kits and packages](Hematology kits and packages.mdx)
**Family**: [Blood manufacturing and hematology systems, components and supplies](../Blood manufacturing and hematology systems, components and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

In this classification a fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products assay is a device used to detect and measure fibrinogen degradation products and fibrin degradation products (protein fragments produced by the enzymatic action of plasmin on fibrinogen and fibrin) as an aid in detecting the presence and degree of intravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis (the dissolution of the fibrin in a blood clot) and in monitoring therapy for disseminated intravascular coagulation (non localized clotting in the blood vessels) US FDA regulates Fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products assay under 21 CFR 864.7320 and under FDA product code MIF.
