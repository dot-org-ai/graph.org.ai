# Erythrocytic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase assay

**UNSPSC Code**: 41131712
**Class**: [Hematology kits and packages](Hematology kits and packages.mdx)
**Family**: [Blood manufacturing and hematology systems, components and supplies](../Blood manufacturing and hematology systems, components and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

In this classification an erythrocytic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase assay is a device used to measure the activity of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase or of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase isoenzymes. The results of this assay are used in the diagnosis and treatment of nonspherocytic congenital hemolytic anemia or drug-induced hemolytic anemia associated with a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. This generic device includes assays based on fluorescence, electrophoresis, methemoglobin reduction, catalase inhibition, and ultraviolet kinetics US FDA regulates Erythrocytic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase assay under 21 CFR 864.736 and under FDA product code JBI.
