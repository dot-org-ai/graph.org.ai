In this classification a leukocyte alkaline phosphatase test is a device used to identify the enzyme leukocyte alkaline phosphatase in neutrophilic granulocytes (granular leukocytes stainable by neutral dyes). The cytochemical identification of alkaline phosphatase depends on the formation of blue granules in cells containing alkaline phosphatase. US FDA regulates Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase test under 21 CFR 864.7660 and under FDA product code GHD.
