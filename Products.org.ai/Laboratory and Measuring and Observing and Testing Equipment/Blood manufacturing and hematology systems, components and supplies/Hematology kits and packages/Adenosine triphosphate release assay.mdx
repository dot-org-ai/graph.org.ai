In this classification an adenosine triphosphate release assay is a device that measures the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from platelets following aggregation. This measurement is made on platelet-rich plasma using a photometer and a luminescent firefly extract. Simultaneous measurements of platelet aggregation and ATP release are used to evaluate platelet function disorders US FDA regulates Adenosine triphosphate release assay under 21 CFR 864.7040 and under FDA product code KHF.
