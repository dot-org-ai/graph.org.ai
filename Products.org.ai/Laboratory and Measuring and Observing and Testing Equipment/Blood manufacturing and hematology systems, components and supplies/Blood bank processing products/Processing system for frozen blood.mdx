In this classification, a processing system for frozen blood is a device used to glycerolize red blood cells prior to freezing to minimize hemolysis (disruption of the red cell membrane accompanied by the release of hemoglobin) due to freezing and thawing of red blood cells and to deglycerolize and wash thawed cells for subsequent reinfusion. US FDA regulates Processing system for frozen blood under 21 CFR 864.9145 and under FDA product code KSW.
