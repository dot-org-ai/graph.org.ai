# Automated sedimentation rate device

**UNSPSC Code**: 41131513
**Class**: [Automated and semi-automated hematology devices](Automated and semi-automated hematology devices.mdx)
**Family**: [Blood manufacturing and hematology systems, components and supplies](../Blood manufacturing and hematology systems, components and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

In this classification, an automated sedimentation rate device is an instrument that measures automatically the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in whole blood. Because an increased sedimentation rate indicates tissue damage or inflammation, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate device is useful in monitoring treatment of a disease. US FDA regulates Automated sedimentation rate device under 21 CFR 864.5800 and under FDA product code GKB.
