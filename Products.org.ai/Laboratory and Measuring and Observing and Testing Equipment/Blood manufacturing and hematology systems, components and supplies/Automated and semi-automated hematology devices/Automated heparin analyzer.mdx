# Automated heparin analyzer

**UNSPSC Code**: 41131511
**Class**: [Automated and semi-automated hematology devices](Automated and semi-automated hematology devices.mdx)
**Family**: [Blood manufacturing and hematology systems, components and supplies](../Blood manufacturing and hematology systems, components and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

In this classification, an automated heparin analyzer is a device used to determine the heparin level in a blood sample by mixing the sample with protamine (a heparin-neutralizing substance) and determining photometrically the onset of air-activated clotting. The analyzer also determines the amount of protamine necessary to neutralize the heparin in the patient's circulation. US FDA regulates Automated heparin analyzer under 21 CFR 864.5680 and under FDA product code JOX.
