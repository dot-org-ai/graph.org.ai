# Resistance temperature detector RTD

**UNSPSC Code**: 41112225
**Class**: [Temperature and heat measuring instruments](Temperature and heat measuring instruments.mdx)
**Family**: [Measuring and observing and testing instruments](../Measuring and observing and testing instruments.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

A wire wound and thin film device that measures temperature using the physical principle of the positive temperature coefficient of electrical resistance of metals. The hotter they become, the larger or higher the value of their electrical resistance.
