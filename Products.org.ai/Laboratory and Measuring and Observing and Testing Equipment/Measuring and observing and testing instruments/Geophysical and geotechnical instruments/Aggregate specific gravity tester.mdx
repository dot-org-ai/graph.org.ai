# Aggregate specific gravity tester

**UNSPSC Code**: 41113820
**Class**: [Geophysical and geotechnical instruments](Geophysical and geotechnical instruments.mdx)
**Family**: [Measuring and observing and testing instruments](../Measuring and observing and testing instruments.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

A tester that measures the specific gravity and absorption rate of thick aggregates. It is used for the analysis test of un-solidified concrete washing and it is structured of prevision specific gravity scale, steel wire for specific gravity measurement and water tank.
