**UNSPSC Code**: 41113815
**Class**: [Geophysical and geotechnical instruments](Geophysical and geotechnical instruments.mdx)
**Family**: [Measuring and observing and testing instruments](../Measuring and observing and testing instruments.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

A tester that measures the contraction limit of soil. The shrinkage limit of soil has its volume not reduced even if the water content of soil is reduced to certain volume or below, and if the water content is increased this device indicates the increase of volume which is shown in function ratio of limit.
