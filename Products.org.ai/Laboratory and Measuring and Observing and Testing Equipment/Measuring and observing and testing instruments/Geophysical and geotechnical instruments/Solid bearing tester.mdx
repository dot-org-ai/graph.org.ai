In order to determine the bearing capacity, the loading plate is installed above the foundation base and applies the weight to measure the settlement on each weight to find the load and subsidence curve. This is a tester that is designed to measure the permitted yield strength of the foundation from the yield strength obtained from the loading test by the loading plate.
