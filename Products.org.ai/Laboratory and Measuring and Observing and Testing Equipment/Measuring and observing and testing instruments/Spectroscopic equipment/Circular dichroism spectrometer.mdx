# Circular dichroism spectrometer

**UNSPSC Code**: 41115419
**Class**: [Spectroscopic equipment](Spectroscopic equipment.mdx)
**Family**: [Measuring and observing and testing instruments](../Measuring and observing and testing instruments.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

A device for analyzing the molecular structure of an optically active substance by applying the electromagnetic field to linearly polarized light to generate left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized light and using the difference in molar extinction coefficient generated when circularly polarized light is passed through the sample.
