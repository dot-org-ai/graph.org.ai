A meter that is designed to measure the output of the low frequency amplifier. It is designed to change the input impedance or output level broadly. The instruction uses the rectifier type voltmeter with the scale of decibel or VU (volume unit) meter inscribed, and when using it, it is important to take the matching of impedance between the measured amplifier and the output meter.
