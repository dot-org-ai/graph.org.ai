# Displacement transducer

**UNSPSC Code**: 41112111
**Class**: [Transducers](Transducers.mdx)
**Family**: [Measuring and observing and testing instruments](../Measuring and observing and testing instruments.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

A transducer that physically moves in response to a change in condition. Displacement transducers are often used for precision measurement of small distances where traditional contact methods of measurement are not feasible
