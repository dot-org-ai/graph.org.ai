A magnetic level gauge is a type of level sensor, i.e., a device used to measure the level of fluids, A magnetic level gauge includes a “floatable” device that can float both in high and low density fluids. Magnetic level gauges may also be designed to accommodate severe environmental conditions up to 210 bars at 370 °C.
