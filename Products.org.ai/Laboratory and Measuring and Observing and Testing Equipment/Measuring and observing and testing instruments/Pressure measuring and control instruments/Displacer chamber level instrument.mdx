# Displacer chamber level instrument

**UNSPSC Code**: 41112424
**Class**: [Pressure measuring and control instruments](Pressure measuring and control instruments.mdx)
**Family**: [Measuring and observing and testing instruments](../Measuring and observing and testing instruments.mdx)
**Segment**: [Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment](../../Laboratory and Measuring and Observing and Testing Equipment.mdx)

Displacement instruments determine liquid level by sensing the buoyant force exerted on a displacer by the liquid it displaces. Unlike floats, in float‐type level instruments, the displacer moves very little relative to the rising or falling liquid.
