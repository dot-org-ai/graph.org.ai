# Multilayer inductor

**UNSPSC Code**: 32121710
**Class**: [Discrete components](Discrete components.mdx)
**Family**: [Passive discrete components](../Passive discrete components.mdx)
**Segment**: [Electronic Components and Supplies](../../Electronic Components and Supplies.mdx)

A type of inductor consisting of a layered coil, wound multiple times around the core. As a result of the multiple layers and the insulation between them, multi-layer inductors have a high inductance level.
