# Low temperature co fired ceramic substrate

**UNSPSC Code**: 32131021
**Class**: [Electronic component parts and raw materials and accessories](Electronic component parts and raw materials and accessories.mdx)
**Family**: [Electronic hardware and component parts and accessories](../Electronic hardware and component parts and accessories.mdx)
**Segment**: [Electronic Components and Supplies](../../Electronic Components and Supplies.mdx)

Multilayer structure to provide the connections for electronic circuits, similar to printed circuit boards, that are joined just prior to firing. It is fired at lower temperatures allowing co-firing with conductive materials such as silver and gold and allowing the inclusion of components such as resistors into the package.
