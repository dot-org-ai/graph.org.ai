# Phase modulation circuit

**UNSPSC Code**: 32101535
**Class**: [Circuit assemblies and radio frequency RF components](Circuit assemblies and radio frequency RF components.mdx)
**Family**: [Printed circuits and integrated circuits and microassemblies](../Printed circuits and integrated circuits and microassemblies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Electronic Components and Supplies](../../Electronic Components and Supplies.mdx)

A circuit network that makes the phase modulation wave with the phase changes, and simultaneously, the amplitude is also changed that it is refined with certain amplitude through the amplitude limiter and synthesizes the phase modulation circuit by the vector synthesis to the modulation wave with the changing size.
