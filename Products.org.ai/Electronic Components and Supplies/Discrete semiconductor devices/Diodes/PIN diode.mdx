# PIN diode

**UNSPSC Code**: 32111514
**Class**: [Diodes](Diodes.mdx)
**Family**: [Discrete semiconductor devices](../Discrete semiconductor devices.mdx)
**Segment**: [Electronic Components and Supplies](../../Electronic Components and Supplies.mdx)

A diode with a wide, lightly doped 'near' intrinsic semiconductor region between a p-type semiconductor and an n-type semiconductor regions. The p-type and n-type regions are typically heavily doped because they are used for ohmic contacts.
