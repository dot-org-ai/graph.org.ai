# Impedance matching network

**UNSPSC Code**: 32111708
**Class**: [Semiconductor devices](Semiconductor devices.mdx)
**Family**: [Discrete semiconductor devices](../Discrete semiconductor devices.mdx)
**Segment**: [Electronic Components and Supplies](../../Electronic Components and Supplies.mdx)

A device which is inserted in between the signal source with the internal impedance and the load impedance to make the impedance of both sides as the same. This is the 2-terminal double network operated to deliver the valid power to the load from the signal source.
