A dolphin is a group of pilings arrayed together to serve variously as a protective hardpoint along a dock, in a waterway, or along a shore; as a means or point of stabilization of a dock, bridge, or similar structure; as a mooring point; and as a base for navigational aids. Dolphins as the name implies are used for mooring only and for securing the vessels by using ropes. They are also commonly used near pier structures to control the transverse movement of berthing vessels.
