# Suction pump, electrical

**UNSPSC Code**: 42293528
**Class**: [Surgical suction and irrigation products](Surgical suction and irrigation products.mdx)
**Family**: [Surgical products](../Surgical products.mdx)
**Segment**: [Medical Equipment and Accessories and Supplies](../../Medical Equipment and Accessories and Supplies.mdx)

A suction pump works by atmospheric pressure; when the piston is raised, creating a partial vacuum, atmospheric pressure outside forces water into the cylinder, whence it is permitted to escape by an outlet valve.
