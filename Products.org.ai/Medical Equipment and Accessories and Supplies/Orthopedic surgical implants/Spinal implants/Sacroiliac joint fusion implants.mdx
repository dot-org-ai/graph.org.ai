The spine and pelvis merge together at the sacroiliac joint. Degeneration or injury at this area results in pain and dysfunction. Specialized devices vary along with the surgical techniques for implantation. These devices may include double headed screws, bars, anchors, or discs inserted to restrict movement at the joint area.
