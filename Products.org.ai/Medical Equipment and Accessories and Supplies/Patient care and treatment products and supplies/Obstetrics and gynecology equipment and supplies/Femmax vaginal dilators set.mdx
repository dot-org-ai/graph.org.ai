A firm rod-like instrument designed to mechanically enlarge the vagina during examination, treatment, and/or during surgical procedures. It can also be inserted into the vagina and worn for prescribed periods to maintain vaginal patency after surgery (e.g., transgender vaginoplasty) or radiation treatments, or to stretch the vaginal orifice (the introitus) when it is unusually narrow due to a birth defect or vaginismus (the inability of the vaginal sphincter to relax). The device is typically available in a set of graduated sizes and the user is typically instructed to begin with the smallest diameter, increasing in size until satisfactory patency is achieved. This is a reusable device.
