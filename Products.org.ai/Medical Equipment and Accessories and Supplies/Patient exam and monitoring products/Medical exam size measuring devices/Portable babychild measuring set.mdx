Portable baby/child length/height measuring board, made of wood, 2boards packed in a carton box. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS: Portable baby/child length-height measuring board is used to measure: a) Recumbent length of a baby up to 24 months old. b) Height of a child aged 24 months and up in vertical position. Has a firm, flat surface. The fold-up mechanism and low weight make it compact and easy to transport. Parts are not losing or shaking during transportation. Panels are secured with self-contained, spring loaded bolts or spring clasps. Carrying when collapsed is facilitated by an integrated handle at the point of equilibrium and removable shoulder/back strap/s. Fixations of the shoulder/back strap/s on the board do not hamper horizontal set-up from lying flat. Simple and fast set up, no tools (screwdriver, etc.) required. No need for calibration, as all parts have prefixed positions. A long-lasting hard-wearing measurement scale is fully integrated with the device.
