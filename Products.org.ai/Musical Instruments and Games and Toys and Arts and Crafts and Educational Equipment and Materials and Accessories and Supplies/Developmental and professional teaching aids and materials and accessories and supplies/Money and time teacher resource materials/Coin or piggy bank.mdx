A traditional name of a coin container normally used by children.  Often used by companies for promotional purposes. The use of the name 'piggy bank' gave rise to its widely recognized 'pig' shape, and many financial service companies use piggy banks as logos for their savings products.  Piggy banks are generally painted and serve as a pedagogical device to teach the rudiments of thrift and savings to children.
