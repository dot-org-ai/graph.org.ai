A Korean traditional percussion instrument, which is also called Beokgu and Maegubuk. It composed of a circular, wooden resonance board which is 170~210mm across and 15~20mm thick, with a handle covered by cowhide or dog skin put on the side of the resonance board. It is played with a small stick to hit the side or the center of the board. Its performance style is not focused on the sound, but rather on the way it is played.
