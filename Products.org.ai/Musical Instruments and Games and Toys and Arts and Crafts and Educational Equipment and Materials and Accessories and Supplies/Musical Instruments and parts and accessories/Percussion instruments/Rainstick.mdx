Also known as waterstick, it is a long and hollow tube filled with small rocks and seeds; internally, there are little wands of bamboo or wood driven into making a spiral which extends through the entire length. When the tube is inclined softly the seeds drop and the tapping with the little wands produces a sound similar to the falling rain or water.
