# Frozen Non GMO vegetables

**UNSPSC Code**: 50600000
**Segment**: [Food and Beverage Products](Food and Beverage Products.mdx)

Plants cultivated Non GMOally for an edible part, as roots, stems, leaves or flower that have been frozen for preservation. Frozen vegetables are those that have been cooled to a temperature at which the vegetable generally becomes hard or rigid in nature. To qualify as being frozen the vegetable should have been subjected to a commercial process for freezing that reached a temperature in excess of -20 degrees Centigrade. Also includes freeze-drying of of these vegetables. This means that they are  produced without the use of methods that genetically modify organisms by means that are not possible under natural conditions.  Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macro-encapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology).  Traditional methods of breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture are considered to be non-GMO.
