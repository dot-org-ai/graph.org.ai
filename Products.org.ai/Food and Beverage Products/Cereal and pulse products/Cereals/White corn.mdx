Corn or zea mays is a cereal, an American grass plant, characterized by having long and solid stems (and not hollow like its closest relatives) at the end of which are spikes or ears (female inflorescences), with their seeds or kernels of corn arranged along its axis. Also called corn (or corn) to these ears and even to their grains once extracted. It is an extremely popular food source, especially in the American continent, which is usually ground to make flour (and prepare various dishes with them, from arepas to tortillas).
