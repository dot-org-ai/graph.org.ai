This tangelo is 1/2 tangerine and 1/2 grapefruit. Characterized by a stem-end neck which tends to make the fruit appear pear or bell-shaped. This appearance has given rise to the name honeybell in the gift fruit trade, but the proper name remains minneola. The fruit is usually fairly large, typically 3 - 3½ inches in diameter. The peel color at peak maturity achieves a bright reddish-orange color. The peel is relatively thin, smooth, and tends to adhere to the internal fruit surface. Seed numbers are few, but variable, and range from 0 up to as many as 15 seeds per fruit It has been dried for preservation.
