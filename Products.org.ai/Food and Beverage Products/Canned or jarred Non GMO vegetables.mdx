# Canned or jarred Non GMO vegetables

**UNSPSC Code**: 50610000
**Segment**: [Food and Beverage Products](Food and Beverage Products.mdx)

Plants cultivated Non GMO originally for an edible part, as roots, stems, leaves or flower that have been canned or jarred for preservation. To qualify as being canned or jarred the vegetable should have been subjected to one or more commercial processes for sterilizing, pressure sealing (vacuum), etc. in order to prevent contamination by microbial agents. This means that they are  produced without the use of methods that genetically modify organisms by means that are not possible under natural conditions.  Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macro-encapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology).  Traditional methods of breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture are considered to be non-GMO.
