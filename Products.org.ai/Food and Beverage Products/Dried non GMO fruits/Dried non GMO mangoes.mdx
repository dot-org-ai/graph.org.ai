**UNSPSC Code**: 50534500
**Family**: [Dried non GMO fruits](Dried non GMO fruits.mdx)
**Segment**: [Food and Beverage Products](../Food and Beverage Products.mdx)

The type of tropical fruit commonly with a firm yellowish red skin, hard central stone, and juicy aromatic pulp, produced by an evergreen tree (mangifera indica) of the cashew family that has been dried for preservation. This means that they are  produced without the use of methods that genetically modify organisms by means that are not possible under natural conditions.   Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macro-encapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology).   Traditional methods of breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture are considered to be non-GMO.
