**UNSPSC Code**: 50534438
**Class**: [Dried non GMO mandarin oranges or tangerines](Dried non GMO mandarin oranges or tangerines.mdx)
**Family**: [Dried non GMO fruits](../Dried non GMO fruits.mdx)
**Segment**: [Food and Beverage Products](../../Food and Beverage Products.mdx)

The variety of any of several cultivated mandarin trees that bear medium-sized largely seedless fruits with thin smooth skin that have been dried for preservation. This means that they are  produced without the use of methods that genetically modify organisms by means that are not possible under natural conditions.   Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macro-encapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology).   Traditional methods of breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture are considered to be non-GMO.
