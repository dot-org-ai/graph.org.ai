# Canned or jarred non GMO minneola tangelo oranges

**UNSPSC Code**: 50554422
**Class**: [Canned or jarred non GMO mandarin oranges or tangerines](Canned or jarred non GMO mandarin oranges or tangerines.mdx)

The variety of tangelo is 1/2 tangerine and 1/2 grapefruit. This means that they are  produced without the use of methods that genetically modify organisms by means that are not possible under natural conditions.   Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macro-encapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology).   Traditional methods of breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture are considered to be non-GMO.
