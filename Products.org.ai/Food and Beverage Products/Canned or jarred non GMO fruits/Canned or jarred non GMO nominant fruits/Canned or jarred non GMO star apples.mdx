# Canned or jarred non GMO star apples

**UNSPSC Code**: 50557036
**Class**: [Canned or jarred non GMO nominant fruits](Canned or jarred non GMO nominant fruits.mdx)
**Family**: [Canned or jarred non GMO fruits](../Canned or jarred non GMO fruits.mdx)
**Segment**: [Food and Beverage Products](../../Food and Beverage Products.mdx)

The variety of carambola or starfruits are ovate to ellipsoid, 2-1/2 to 5 inches (6 to 13 cm) in length, with 5 (rarely 4 or 6) prominent longitudinal ribs. This means that they are  produced without the use of methods that genetically modify organisms by means that are not possible under natural conditions.   Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macro-encapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology).   Traditional methods of breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture are considered to be non-GMO.
