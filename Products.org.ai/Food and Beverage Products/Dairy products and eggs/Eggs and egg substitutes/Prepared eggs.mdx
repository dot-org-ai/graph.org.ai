**Class**: [Eggs and egg substitutes](Eggs and egg substitutes.mdx)

Includes any product that has been prepared to a specific recipe where eggs are the main ingredient in combination with other ingredients such as protein, vegetables or sauce. These ingredients form a valuable part of the product, rather than just serve as a seasoning or flavouring. Omelettes and souffles would be examples of prepared egg products.
