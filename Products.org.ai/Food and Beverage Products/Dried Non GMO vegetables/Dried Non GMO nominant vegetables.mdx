# Dried Non GMO nominant vegetables

**UNSPSC Code**: 50596800
**Family**: [Dried Non GMO vegetables](Dried Non GMO vegetables.mdx)
**Segment**: [Food and Beverage Products](../Food and Beverage Products.mdx)

Vegetable types that belong to no other class and have no other vegetable commodities related to them that have been dried for preservation. This means that they are  produced without the use of methods that genetically modify organisms by means that are not possible under natural conditions.  Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macro-encapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology).  Traditional methods of breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture are considered to be non-GMO.
