Papa Canchan, also called Papa Rosada (Pink Potato), has a pink, thin skin. The meat is of a pale whitish color like Papas Blancas, therefore probably sometimes sold under this name, but they stay much firmer when cooked and have a better flavor. Papas Canchans find a use in Peruvian stews, soups and the famous Pachamanca. It is also the most common potato variety used for Papa Rellena.
