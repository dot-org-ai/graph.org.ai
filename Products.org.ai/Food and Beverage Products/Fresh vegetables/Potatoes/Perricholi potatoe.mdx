A recently developed variety of potatoe popular in Peru. Papa Perrichilo, named after the stage actress Michaela Villegas, is similar to the Papa Blanca (white potato); sweet and watery, ideal for frying. Because it does not change color or get brownish after peeling the Papa Perricholi is often used in commercial kitchens, restaurants and for industrially made French fries.
