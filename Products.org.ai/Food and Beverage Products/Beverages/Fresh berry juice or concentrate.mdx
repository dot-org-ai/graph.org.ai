Berry juices are made by extracting the liquid part of the fruit. Juices may contain a mixture of vegetables or fruits and will commonly retain the taste of the primary ingredient. Concentrate is a condensed liquid form of the product which has had the majority of its base component, primarily water, removed. Generally, concentrate solids do not contain pulp, seeds or rind.
