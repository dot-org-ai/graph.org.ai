# Fresh citrus juice or concentrate

**UNSPSC Code**: 50202400
**Family**: [Beverages](Beverages.mdx)
**Segment**: [Food and Beverage Products](../Food and Beverage Products.mdx)

Citrus juice are those that contain a high proportion of citric acid giving them their characteristic astringent odour and flavour and are also good sources of vitamin c. Juices are made by extracting the liquid part of a vegetable or fruit. They may contain a mixture of vegetables or fruits and will commonly retain the taste of the primary ingredient. Concentrate is a condensed liquid form of the product which has had the majority of its base component, primarily water, removed. Generally, concentrate solids do not contain pulp, seeds or rind.
