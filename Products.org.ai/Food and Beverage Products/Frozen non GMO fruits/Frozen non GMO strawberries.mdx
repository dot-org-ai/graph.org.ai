**Segment**: [Food and Beverage Products](../Food and Beverage Products.mdx)

The type of juicy edible usually red fruit of any of several low-growing temperate herbs (genus fragaria) of the rose family that is technically an enlarged pulpy receptacle bearing numerous achenes that has been frozen for preservation. This means that they are  produced without the use of methods that genetically modify organisms by means that are not possible under natural conditions.   Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macro-encapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology).   Traditional methods of breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture are considered to be non-GMO.
