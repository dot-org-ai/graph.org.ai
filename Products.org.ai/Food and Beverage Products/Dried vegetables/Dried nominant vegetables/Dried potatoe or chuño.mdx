The chuño or chuno native to the central Andes (processed potato), is the result of dehydration (usually by lyophilization) of potatoes, or other tubers of height. Making chuño is the traditional way of conserving and storing potatoes for long periods, sometimes for years. This product is one of the central elements of indigenous food and, in general, of the cuisine of the highland region of South America, particularly Bolivia and Peru.
