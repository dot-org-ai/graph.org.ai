A lime grown especially in the florida keys and adjacent area. Smaller than regular "persian" limes, the peel is thin, smooth and greenish-yellow when ripe. The flesh is also greenish-yellow and full of seeds. The interior is divided by 10 to 12 segments, quite juicy and has a higher acidity than regular persian limes.
