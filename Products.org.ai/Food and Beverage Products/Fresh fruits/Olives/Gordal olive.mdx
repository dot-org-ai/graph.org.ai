# Gordal olive

Also known as the "queen olive", the gordal is large, generously-proportioned olive from Andalucia. It has a mild, classic green olive flavor, similar to the ever-popular manzanilla, and a nice meaty texture. Its large size makes it perfect for stuffing: pickled garlic, onion, an anchovy, a slice of roasted pepper, a scoop of soft blue cheese... the only limit is your imagination.
