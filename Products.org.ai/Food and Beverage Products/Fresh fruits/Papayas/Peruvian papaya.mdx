The papaya, whose scientific name is Carica papaya, belongs to the Caricaceas family, and comes from Central America, probably from the south of Mexico and the north of Nicaragua. It was first discovered by Europeans in 1535 by Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo, who reported having seen papaya plants in said region. Its subsequent spread to the Caribbean and South America was due to Spanish and Portuguese conquest and settlement . In these places, papaya is known by different names such as fruta bomba, lechosa, papaw, pawpaw among others. In Peru there are diverse species growing in tropical zones.
