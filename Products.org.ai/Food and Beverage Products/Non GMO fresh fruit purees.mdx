# Non GMO fresh fruit purees

**UNSPSC Code**: 50560000
**Segment**: [Food and Beverage Products](Food and Beverage Products.mdx)

Non GMO fruits which have been pureed by being ground, pressed, blended, and/or sieved to the consistency of a soft creamy paste or thick liquid. Non GMO fruits have been grown without the use of methods that genetically modify organisms by means that are not possible under natural conditions.  Such methods include cell fusion, microencapsulation and macro-encapsulation, and recombinant DNA technology (including gene deletion, gene doubling, introducing a foreign gene, and changing the positions of genes when achieved by recombinant DNA technology).  Traditional methods of breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro fertilization, or tissue culture are considered to be non-GMO.
