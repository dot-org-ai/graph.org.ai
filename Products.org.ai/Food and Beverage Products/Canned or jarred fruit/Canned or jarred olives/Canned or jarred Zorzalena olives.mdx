# Canned or jarred Zorzalena olives

When harvested, these olives are still in the middle of the maturation process, creating a product that is homogeneous in color, a beautiful deep olive green. One of the main characteristics of this variety is the strength and vigor of the olive tree, which for decades has been used to graft weaker varieties, taking advantage of the strong zorzaleña roots.
