# Nutritional supplements

**UNSPSC Code**: 50500000
**Segment**: [Food and Beverage Products](Food and Beverage Products.mdx)

A dietary or nutritional supplement is intended to provide nutrients that may otherwise not be consumed in sufficient quantities through a varied diet. Supplements are generally understood to include vitamins, minerals, fiber, fatty acids, or amino acids, and other substances. U.S. authorities define dietary supplements as foods, while elsewhere they may be classified as drugs. These products are not intended to prevent or treat any disease (other than nutritional definciencies). The U.S. National Institutes of Health says that certain supplements "may have value."
