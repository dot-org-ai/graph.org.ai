Nutritional supplements are used to ensure that adequate amounts of nutrients are obtained on a daily basis, if optimal amounts cannot be obtained through a varied diet. Omega-6 fatty acids are a family of unsaturated fatty acids that have in common a final carbon–carbon double bond in the n-6 position. Certain Omega-6 fatty acids are considered essential fatty acids, meaning that they cannot be synthesized by the human body.
