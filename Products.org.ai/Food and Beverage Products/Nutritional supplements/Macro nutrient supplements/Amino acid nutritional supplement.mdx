Nutritional supplements are used to ensure that adequate amounts of nutrients are obtained on a daily basis, if optimal amounts cannot be obtained through a varied diet. Essential amino acids cannot be synthesized natively by humans and therefore must be supplied in the diet.  Essential amino acides include Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Threonine, Tryptophan and Valine. Nonessential amino acids include Alanine, Arginine, Aspartic acid, Cysteine, Glutamic acid, Glutamine, Glycine, Proline, Serine, Tyrosine, Asparagine and Selenocysteine.
