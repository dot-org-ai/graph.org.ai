Meal replacement generally refers to a calorie-controlled, prepackaged product in the form of a bar or beverage (ready to drink or powder) that replaces a regular meal. Meal-replacement products usually provide limited calories per serving, are fortified with vitamins and minerals, and often bear nutrient content claims such as percent of calories from fat or sugar.
