Vitamin supplements are used to ensure that adequate amounts of nutrients are obtained on a daily basis, if optimal amounts cannot be obtained through a varied diet. Vitamin K is a group of structurally similar, fat-soluble vitamins (2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone (3-) derivatives) that the human body needs for posttranslational modification of certain proteins required for blood coagulation, and in metabolic pathways in bone and other tissue.
