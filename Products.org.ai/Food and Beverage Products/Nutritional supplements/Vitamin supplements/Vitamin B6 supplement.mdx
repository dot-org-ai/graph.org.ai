Vitamin supplements are used to ensure that adequate amounts of nutrients are obtained on a daily basis, if optimal amounts cannot be obtained through a varied diet. Several forms of the vitamin B6 are known, but pyridoxal phosphate is the active form and is a cofactor in many reactions of amino acid metabolism, including transamination, deamination, and decarboxylation. It is also necessary for the enzymatic reaction governing the release of glucose from glycogen.
