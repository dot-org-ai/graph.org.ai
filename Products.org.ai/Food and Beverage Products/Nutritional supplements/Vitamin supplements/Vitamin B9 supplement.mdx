Vitamin supplements are used to ensure that adequate amounts of nutrients are obtained on a daily basis, if optimal amounts cannot be obtained through a varied diet. Vitamin B9 (or Folic acid, folate, vitamin M, vitamin Bc, folacin, pteroyl-L-glutamic acid, and pteroyl-L-glutamate) are forms of the water-soluble vitamin B9. The human body needs folate to synthesize and repair DNA, as well as for other functions.
