Vitamin supplements are used to ensure that adequate amounts of nutrients are obtained on a daily basis, if optimal amounts cannot be obtained through a varied diet. Vitamin C (or L-ascorbic acid, or ascorbate (the anion of ascorbic acid)) is an essential nutrient for humans and certain other animal species. Vitamin C refers to a number of vitamers that have vitamin C activity in animals, including ascorbic acid and its salts, and some oxidized forms of the molecule like dehydroascorbic acid.
