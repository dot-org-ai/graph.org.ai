Mineral supplements are used to ensure that adequate amounts of nutrients are obtained on a daily basis, if optimal amounts cannot be obtained through a varied diet. Dietary fluoride supplements in the form of tablets, lozenges, or liquids (including fluoride-vitamin preparations) are used primarily for children in areas without fluoridated drinking water. The supplements prevent cavities in permanent teeth.
