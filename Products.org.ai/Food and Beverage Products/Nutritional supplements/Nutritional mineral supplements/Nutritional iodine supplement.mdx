Mineral supplements are used to ensure that adequate amounts of nutrients are obtained on a daily basis, if optimal amounts cannot be obtained through a varied diet. Iodine is required for the synthesis of thyroid hormones, thyroxine and triiodothyronine and to prevent goiter, and also for mammary and salivary glands and for gastric mucosa and immune system (thymus).
