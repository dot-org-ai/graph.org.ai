**UNSPSC Code**: 31411806
**Class**: [Diaphragm seals](Diaphragm seals.mdx)
**Family**: [Seals](../Seals.mdx)
**Segment**: [Manufacturing Components and Supplies](../../Manufacturing Components and Supplies.mdx)

O-rings seals are very commonly found in pumps, cylinders, connectors and valves, helping to seal joins between separate parts and prevent leaking of fluids and gases. They're used with static, dynamic, hydraulic and pneumatic components, making them an especially versatile solution to a very widespread engineering issue.
