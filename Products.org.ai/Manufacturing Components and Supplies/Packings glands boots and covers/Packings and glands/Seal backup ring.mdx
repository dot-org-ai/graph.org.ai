# Seal backup ring

**UNSPSC Code**: 31181705
**Class**: [Packings and glands](Packings and glands.mdx)
**Family**: [Packings glands boots and covers](../Packings glands boots and covers.mdx)
**Segment**: [Manufacturing Components and Supplies](../../Manufacturing Components and Supplies.mdx)

A type of ring having backup holding and sealing action. Back-up rings are washer-like devices that are used to prevent a seal from extruding through any gaps while under pressure. Back-up rings are not seals themselves, but are usually used in conjunction with O-rings in high-pressure applications and are installed in the downstream side of the gland.
