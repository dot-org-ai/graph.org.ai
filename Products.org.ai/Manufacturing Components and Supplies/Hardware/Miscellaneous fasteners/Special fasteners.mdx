Special fasteners refer to a type of fastening hardware that is designed for specific applications and requirements. They are typically made to order or custom-made according to the specifications of the application. Unlike standard fasteners, which have standard dimensions and are readily available, special fasteners are unique and have specific features that meet the needs of the application.Temporary fasteners are designed specifically to join two materials or objects, with the option to be removed and reused without damaging the objects they hold together. Common examples include bolts, screws, nuts, washers and studs.
