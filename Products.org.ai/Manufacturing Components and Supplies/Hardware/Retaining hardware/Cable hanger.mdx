Used as a positioning connector (hanger) on a wire rope, it allows the wire rope to be inserted into a cam from only one direction without allowing the rope to slip or pull out. It consists of a metal frame with an eye (loop) at one end and a metal cam inside the frame. Once it is slid on the span of the wire rope, it is connected from the eye end to an anchor.
