A jointing gasket is a type of gasket that is used to provide a tight seal between two mating surfaces that have irregular or non-parallel surfaces. They are typically made from materials such as rubber, cork, or fiber and can be cut or molded to fit the shape of the mating surfaces. Jointing gaskets are designed to compress and fill the gaps between the mating surfaces, which creates a seal that prevents the leakage of fluids or gases. They can be used in various applications where a tight seal is required, including in pipe fittings, flanges, and valve bonnets.The assembly of components (eg-flanges, bolts, gaskets etc.) required to join two or more items of process equipment and to prevent leakage.
