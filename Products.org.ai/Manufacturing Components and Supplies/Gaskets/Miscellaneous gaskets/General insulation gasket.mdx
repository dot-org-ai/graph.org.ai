# General insulation gasket

**UNSPSC Code**: 31402003
**Class**: [Miscellaneous gaskets](Miscellaneous gaskets.mdx)
**Family**: [Gaskets](../Gaskets.mdx)
**Segment**: [Manufacturing Components and Supplies](../../Manufacturing Components and Supplies.mdx)

Insulation gasket act as an insulator between dissimilar metallic flanges. Also, they are used to isolate sections of pipework (dissimilar metals) electrically in the cathodic protection systems, thus preventing the electrostatic charge flow along the pipelines as they remove the possibility of galvanic cell system creation.
