# Right angle gearbox

**UNSPSC Code**: 31171719
**Class**: [Gears](Gears.mdx)
**Family**: [Bearings and bushings and wheels and gears](../Bearings and bushings and wheels and gears.mdx)
**Segment**: [Manufacturing Components and Supplies](../../Manufacturing Components and Supplies.mdx)

Right angle gearboxes are characterized by the fact that the drive shaft and the output shaft are arranged at an angle of 90 degrees. Depending on the gearbox type, the axes can intersect in a plane or cross on two parallel planes, which results in an axis offset.
