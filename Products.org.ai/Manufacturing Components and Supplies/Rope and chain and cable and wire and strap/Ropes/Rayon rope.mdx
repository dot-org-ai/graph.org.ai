# Rayon rope

**UNSPSC Code**: 31151510

Rayon is a material made from synthetic textile fibers produced by forcing a cellulose solution through fine spinnerets and solidifying the resulting filaments, with this material we get a silk-like texture rope but more resistant than silk, and it is good to control mite infestation.
