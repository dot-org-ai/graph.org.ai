# Wire rope and chain fitting

**UNSPSC Code**: 31151522
**Class**: [Ropes](Ropes.mdx)
**Family**: [Rope and chain and cable and wire and strap](../Rope and chain and cable and wire and strap.mdx)
**Segment**: [Manufacturing Components and Supplies](../../Manufacturing Components and Supplies.mdx)

Wire rope is constructed using multiple wires and strands. This means that the weight, pressure and stress of a load is spread out across multiple pieces of metal, rather than being reliant on one wire or strand alone.
