# Raffia rope

**UNSPSC Code**: 31151516
**Class**: [Ropes](Ropes.mdx)
**Family**: [Rope and chain and cable and wire and strap](../Rope and chain and cable and wire and strap.mdx)

The fiber of the raffia is obtained from the leaves of the raffia palm that is found in South America, Africa and Madagascar, and with this raw material we get a rope very resistant and with a long life, the raffia can be also synthetic.
