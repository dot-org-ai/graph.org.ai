# Sealants

**UNSPSC Code**: 31201700
**Family**: [Adhesives and sealants](Adhesives and sealants.mdx)
**Segment**: [Manufacturing Components and Supplies](../Manufacturing Components and Supplies.mdx)

A group of products used to close small openings that are difficult to shut with other materials, such as concrete, drywall, etc.  Desirable properties of sealants include insolubility, corrosion resistance, and adhesion. Uses of sealants vary widely and sealants are used in many industries, for example, construction, automotive and aerospace industries.  The main difference between adhesives and sealants is that sealants typically have lower strength and higher elongation than do adhesives. Since the main objective of a sealant is to seal assemblies and joints, sealants need to have sufficient adhesion to the substrates and resistance to environmental conditions to remain bonded over the required life of the assembly.  Sealants fall between higher-strength adhesives at one end and extremely low-strength putties and caulks at the other.
