# Transient protection materials

**UNSPSC Code**: 39121620
**Class**: [Circuit protection devices and accessories](Circuit protection devices and accessories.mdx)
**Family**: [Electrical equipment and components and supplies](../Electrical equipment and components and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Electrical Systems and Lighting and Components and Accessories and Supplies](../../Electrical Systems and Lighting and Components and Accessories and Supplies.mdx)

Transient protection modules, when combined with other measures, can help prevent problems caused by voltage transients. Transient energy may come from several sources, most typically environmental conditions or induced by switching heavy inductive loads. Sensors, readers, IT installations, etc., can be seriously affected if they are not protected.
