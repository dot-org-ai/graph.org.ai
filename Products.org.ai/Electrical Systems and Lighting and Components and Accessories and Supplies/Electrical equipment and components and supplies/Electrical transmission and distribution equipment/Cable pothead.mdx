Cable potheads are used in substations to terminate the high-voltage, oil-filled transmission cables. As termination points, potheads have two basic functions. One function is to provide an electrical connection between the underground cable and the overhead bus. The other function is to provide a seal or end cap for the dielectric oil system.
