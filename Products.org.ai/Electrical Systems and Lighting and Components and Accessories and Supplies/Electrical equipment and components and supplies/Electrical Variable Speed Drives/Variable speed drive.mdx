# Variable speed drive

**UNSPSC Code**: 39122006
**Class**: [Electrical Variable Speed Drives](Electrical Variable Speed Drives.mdx)
**Family**: [Electrical equipment and components and supplies](../Electrical equipment and components and supplies.mdx)

The basic function of a variable speed drive (VSD) is to control the flow of energy from the mains to the process. Variable speed drives sit between the electrical supply and the motor. Power from the electrical supply goes into a drive and the drive then regulates the power that is fed to the motor.
