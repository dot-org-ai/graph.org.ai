Drive device which enables the connection of ships in port to shore side electricity to power on board services. This enables ships’ diesel generators to be switched off, thereby reducing noise and emissions, such as particulate matter, nitrogen, sulphur and carbon oxides, and volatile organic compounds.  Since 2012, an international standard on shore power, (ISO/IEC/IEEC 80005-1), has been in place to ensure worldwide compatibility between ports and vessels.
