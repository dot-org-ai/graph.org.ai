# Zero phase current transformer

**UNSPSC Code**: 39121034
**Class**: [Power conditioning equipment](Power conditioning equipment.mdx)
**Family**: [Electrical equipment and components and supplies](../Electrical equipment and components and supplies.mdx)
**Segment**: [Electrical Systems and Lighting and Components and Accessories and Supplies](../../Electrical Systems and Lighting and Components and Accessories and Supplies.mdx)

The current transformers used to prevent malfunction of a ground relay for electric power distribution. The current generates through the process in which 3-level conductors pass through an iron core with the secondary coil wound on it, which produces magnetic balance.
