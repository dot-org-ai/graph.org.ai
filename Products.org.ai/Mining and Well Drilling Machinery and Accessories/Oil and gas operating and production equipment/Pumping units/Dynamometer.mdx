A Dynamometer is a diagnostic device used on Sucker Rod Pumped Wells that measures the load on the top rod (Polished Rod) and plots this load in relation to the polished rod position as the pumping unit moves through each stroke cycle. The plot of the polished rod Load vs Position is known as the Surface Card.
