The wellhead equipment is the component at the surface of an oil or gas well, which offers the pressure-containing and structural interface for the drilling equipment. It provides pressure seals and suspension points for the casing strings. It forms an integral structure of the well. Generally, the wellhead consists of three components: (1) the casing head, (2) the tubing head, and (3) the Christmas tree. The casing head consists of heavy fittings that provide a seal between the casing and the surface.
