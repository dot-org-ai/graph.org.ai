# Expandable plug

**UNSPSC Code**: 20123205
**Class**: [Expandable downhole equipment](Expandable downhole equipment.mdx)

An expandable plug particularly adapted to plug an engine's oil pan drain hole. The expandable plug includes a threaded bolt, a compression plate assembled with the bolt, and a compression nut assembled with the bolt and adapted to bear against the compression plate. A resiliently deformable section of tubing is assembled in slip fit relation with the bolt, the tubing section being axially compressible and radially deformable but not being a specially molded part. With the plug located within the pan's drain hole, tightening of the compression nut causes the tubing section to bulge outwardly into a liquid sealing with the hole, and also to bulge inwardly into liquid sealing relation with the bolt, thereby plugging the drain hole against oil flow therethrough.
