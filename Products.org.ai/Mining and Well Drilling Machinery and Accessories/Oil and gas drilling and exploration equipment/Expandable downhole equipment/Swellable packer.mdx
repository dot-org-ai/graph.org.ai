# Swellable packer

**UNSPSC Code**: 20123206
**Class**: [Expandable downhole equipment](Expandable downhole equipment.mdx)
**Family**: [Oil and gas drilling and exploration equipment](../Oil and gas drilling and exploration equipment.mdx)
**Segment**: [Mining and Well Drilling Machinery and Accessories](../../Mining and Well Drilling Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

The packer swells on contact with either oil or water and expands to seal the annulus around the pipe. The short packer element enhances well integrity and is better able to traverse tight open hole sections and lateral transitions.
