# Wireline stuffing box 

**UNSPSC Code**: 20122374
**Class**: [Slickline equipment](Slickline equipment.mdx)
**Family**: [Oil and gas drilling and exploration equipment](../Oil and gas drilling and exploration equipment.mdx)
**Segment**: [Mining and Well Drilling Machinery and Accessories](../../Mining and Well Drilling Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

The stuffing box is specifically designed to seal around solid wireline (slickline) to confine wellbore fluids and gases within the surface pressure equipment. This allows wireline operations to be carried out under pressure. The stuffing box can be operated either manually or hydraulically without part modifications.
