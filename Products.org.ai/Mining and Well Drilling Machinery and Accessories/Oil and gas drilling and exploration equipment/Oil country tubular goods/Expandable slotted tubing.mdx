# Expandable slotted tubing

**UNSPSC Code**: 20122717
**Class**: [Oil country tubular goods](Oil country tubular goods.mdx)
**Family**: [Oil and gas drilling and exploration equipment](../Oil and gas drilling and exploration equipment.mdx)
**Segment**: [Mining and Well Drilling Machinery and Accessories](../../Mining and Well Drilling Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

With an expandable slotted tubing (EST), and fiber-cement wellbore lining, the system has been developed. Its purpose is to temporarily secure the integrity of a wellbore section in order to allow drilling operations to continue through deeper over pressured or depleted zones. The lining is installed below the previous casing with no or minimal reduction in hole diameter.
