A permanent downhole gauge (PDG) is a pressure and/or temperature gauge permanently installed in an oil or gas well. Typically they are installed in tubing in the well and can measure the tubing pressure or annulus pressure or both. Systems installed in well casing to read formation pressure directly, suspended systems, and systems built in coil (continuous) tubing are also available. The data that PDGs provide are useful to Reservoir Engineers in determining the quantities of oil or gas contained below the Earth's surface in an oil or gas reservoir and also which method of production is best.
