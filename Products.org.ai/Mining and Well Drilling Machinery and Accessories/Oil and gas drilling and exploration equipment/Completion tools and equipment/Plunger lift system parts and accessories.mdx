Component parts of a system that unloads gas wells and high gas/liquid ratio oil wells without interrupting production.These include a plunger that travels to the bottom of the well where the fluid is picked up and, acting as a swab, is brought to the surface removing all liquids in the tubing.The system uses the well's own energy requiring no additional power expense.
