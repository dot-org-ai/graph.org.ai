# Expandable downhole equipment

**UNSPSC Code**: 20123200
**Family**: [Oil and gas drilling and exploration equipment](Oil and gas drilling and exploration equipment.mdx)
**Segment**: [Mining and Well Drilling Machinery and Accessories](../Mining and Well Drilling Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

Drilling equipment and tubulars that can expand or inflate with help of gas or liquid.Expandable tubular technology concentrates on reducing the telescopic profile of well designs through a downhole tube expansion process. Wider applications of the technology exist for example water shut off, and casing repairs in old wells.To reduce the loss of diameter each time a new casing string or liner is set, a cold working process has been developed whereby the casing or liner can be expanded by up to 20% in diameter after being run down-hole.
