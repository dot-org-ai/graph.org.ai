A magnetically coated strip of plastic on which data can be encoded. Tapes storage capacities range from a few hundred kilobytes to several gigabytes. Tapes are sequential-access media, which means that to get to a particular point on the tape, the tape must go through all the preceding points. Because tapes are so slow, they are generally used only for long-term storage and backup or for transporting large amounts of data.
