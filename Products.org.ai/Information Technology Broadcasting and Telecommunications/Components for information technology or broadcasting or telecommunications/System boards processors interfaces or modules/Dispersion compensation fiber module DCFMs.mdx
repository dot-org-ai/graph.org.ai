# Dispersion compensation fiber module DCFMs

**UNSPSC Code**: 43201508
**Class**: [System boards processors interfaces or modules](System boards processors interfaces or modules.mdx)
**Family**: [Components for information technology or broadcasting or telecommunications](../Components for information technology or broadcasting or telecommunications.mdx)
**Segment**: [Information Technology Broadcasting and Telecommunications](../../Information Technology Broadcasting and Telecommunications.mdx)

Modules used in optical networks to compensate for the distortion in optical signals as they are transmitted through the network. During long haul transmission in optical fiber cable, signal light is attenuated and signal shape is distorted by chromatic dispersion inherent in the optical fiber. By remedying the attenuation and distortion at the optical amplifier and dispersion compensation module, a large capacity transmission becomes possible.
