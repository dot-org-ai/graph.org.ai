WDM (wavelength division multiplexing), in which several baseband-modulated channels are transmitted along a single fiber but with each channel located at a different wavelength. Each of N different wavelength lasers is operating at the slower Gbps speeds, but the aggregate system is transmitting at N times the individual laser speed, providing a significant capacity enhancement. The WDM channels are separated in wavelength to avoid cross-talk when they are (de)multiplexed by a non-ideal optical fiber. The wavelengths can be individually routed through a network or individually recovered by wavelength-selective components. WDM allows us to use much of the fiber bandwidth, although various device, system, and network issues will limit the utilization of the full fiber bandwidth. Note that each WDM channel may contain a set of even slower time-multiplexed channels. (Definition - http://www.rad.com/)
