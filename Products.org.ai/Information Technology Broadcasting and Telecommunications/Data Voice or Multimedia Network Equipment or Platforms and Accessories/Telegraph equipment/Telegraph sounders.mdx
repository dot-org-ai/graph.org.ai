A component of a telegraph system that could recognize the different sounds made by the register as dots and dashes. This device used an electromagnet to pull on a piece of iron and make a clicking sound. When the electromagnet pulled on the iron, it made a more solid and heavy sounding click and when it released the iron, it made a thinner and lighter sounding click. Operators learned to discriminate between these two sounds and to use this ability to tell whether they were hearing a dot or a dash.
