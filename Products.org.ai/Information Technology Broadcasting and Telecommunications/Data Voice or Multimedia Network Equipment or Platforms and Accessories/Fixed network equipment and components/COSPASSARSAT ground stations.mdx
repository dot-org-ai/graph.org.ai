Cospas-Sarsat ground stations are called Local User Terminals (LUTs).  These satellite receiving units are the ground stations that receive emergency beacon distress alerts. Once a signal is received and processed at the LUT it is transmitted to the mission control center (MCC) that operates that particular LUT. The LUTs are fully automated and completely unmanned at all times
