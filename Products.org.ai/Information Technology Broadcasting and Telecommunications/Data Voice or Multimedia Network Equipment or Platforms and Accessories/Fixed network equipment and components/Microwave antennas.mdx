An antenna is a specialized transducer that converts radio-frequency (RF) fields into alternating current (AC) or vice-versa, in this case for transmitting microwave, or high end frequencies. There are two basic types: the receiving antenna, which intercepts RF energy and delivers AC to electronic equipment, and the transmitting antenna, which is fed with AC from electronic equipment and generates an RF field. Microwave antennas offer point to point and point to multipoint microwave communication which operate in the UHF,EHF and SHF frequency bands.
