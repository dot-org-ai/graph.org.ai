An antenna is a specialized transducer that converts radio-frequency (RF) fields into alternating current (AC) or vice-versa, in this case for transmitting radar or low end RF frequencies. There are two basic types: the receiving antenna, which intercepts RF energy and delivers AC to electronic equipment, and the transmitting antenna, which is fed with AC from electronic equipment and generates an RF field. Radar antennas operate in the UHF part of the radio frequency spectrum and is used to detect the position and/or movement of objects.
