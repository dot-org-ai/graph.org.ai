An antenna is a specialized transducer that converts radio-frequency (RF) fields into alternating current (AC) or vice-versa, in this case for transmitting television frequencies. There are two basic types: the receiving antenna, which intercepts RF energy and delivers AC to electronic equipment, and the transmitting antenna, which is fed with AC from electronic equipment and generates an RF field. Television antennas are directional antennas and receive signals in the VHF,UHF or VHF/UHF range.
