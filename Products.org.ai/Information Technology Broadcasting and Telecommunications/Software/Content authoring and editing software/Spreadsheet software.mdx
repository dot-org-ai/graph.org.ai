Spreadsheet software is a type of application program which manipulates numerical and string data in rows and columns of cells. The value in a cell can be calculated from a formula which can involve other cells. A value is recalculated automatically whenever a value on which it depends changes. Different cells may be displayed with different formats.Microsoft, Lotus, Borland and many other companies offer Windows-based spreadsheet programs. Some spreadsheet support three-dimensional matrices and cyclic references which lead to iterative calculation.
