Optical character recognition (OCR) is the process of converting an image of text, such as a scanned paper document or electronic fax file, into electronic text. The text in an image is not editable: the letters are made of tiny dots (pixels) that together form a picture of text. During OCR, the software analyzes an image and converts the pictures of the characters to editable text based on the patterns of the pixels in the image. OCR also enables screen readers and refreshable Braille displays to read the text contained in some images. The software used for OCR is called OCR software.
