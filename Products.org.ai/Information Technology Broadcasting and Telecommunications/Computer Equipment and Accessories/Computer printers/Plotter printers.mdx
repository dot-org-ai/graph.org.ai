A plotter is a printer that interprets commands from a computer to make line drawings on paper. Unlike a regular printer, the plotter can draw continuous point-to-point lines directly from vector graphics files or commands. It uses one or more pens that can be raised, lowered and moved over the printing media to draw graphics or text.The heart of the plotter is the printer head assembly,consisting of a horizontal bar and, attached to it, the head assembly holding the pen in use. The pen can be positioned horizontally by moving the pen assembly along the bar.Vertical positioning is achieved by either moving the bar(stationary page plotter) or the paper (rolling page plotter).Combinations of horizontal and vertical movement are used to draw arbitrary lines and curves in a single action, in contrast to printers which usually scan horizontally across the page.
