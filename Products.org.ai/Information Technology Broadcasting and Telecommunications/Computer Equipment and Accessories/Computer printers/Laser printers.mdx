Uses the same technology as copy machines. A non-impact high-resolution printer which uses a rotating disk to reflect laser beams to forms an electrostatic image on an imaging [developer] drum. This attracts electrically charged toner (dry ink powder,generally a plastic heat-sensitive polymer) which is then transferred onto the paper and fused into it by heat. Laser printers produce very high quality text and graphics.
