A touch screen can be CRT or LCD and is a computer display screen that is sensitive to human touch, allowing a user to interact with the computer by touching pictures or words on the screen. Touch screens are used with information kiosks, computer-based training devices, and systems designed to help individuals who have difficulty manipulating a mouse or keyboard. Touch screen technology can also be used as an alternative user interface with applications that normally require a mouse, such as a Web browser. Often this uses beams of infrared light that are projected across the screen surface. Interrupting the beams generates an electronic signal identifying the location of the screen.Software interprets the signal and performs the required operation.
