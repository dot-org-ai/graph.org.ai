A cathode-ray tube and associated electronics connected to a computers video output. A monitor may be either monochrome (black and white) or colour (RGB). Colour monitors may show either digital colour (each of the red,green and blue signals may be either on or off, giving eight possible colours: black, white, red, green, blue, cyan,magenta and yellow) or analog colour (red, green and blue signals are continuously variable following any combination to be displayed). Digital monitors are sometimes known as TTL because the voltages on the red, green and blue inputs are compatible with TTL logic chips.
