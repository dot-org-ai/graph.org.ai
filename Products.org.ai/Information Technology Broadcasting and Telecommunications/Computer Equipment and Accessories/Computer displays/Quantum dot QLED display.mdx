A quantum dot display is a display device that uses quantum dots (QD), semiconductor nanocrystals which can produce pure monochromatic red, green, and blue light when they are excited by an energy source. Quantum displays are either photo-emissive (photoluminescent) or electro-emissive (electroluminescent) allowing them to be readily incorporated into new emissive display architectures.
