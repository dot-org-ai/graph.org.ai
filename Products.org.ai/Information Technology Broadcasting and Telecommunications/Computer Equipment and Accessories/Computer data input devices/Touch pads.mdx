A stationary pointing device used mainly on laptop computers. Touchpads provide a small, flat surface that you slide your finger over as an alternative to the mouse and works by sensing the user's finger movement and downward pressure. They were developed to provide a more natural or intuitive connection for the user than the mouse.
