RFID (radio frequency identification) is a technology that incorporates the use of electromagnetic or electrostatic coupling in the radio frequency (RF) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum to uniquely identify an object, animal, or person. An RFID system consists of three components: an antenna and transceiver (often combined into one reader) and a transponder (the tag). RFID is sometimes called dedicated short range communication (DSRC).
