A 'thin client' is a network computer without a hard disk drive, whereas a typical PC computer includes a disk drive. In client/server applications, a client designed to be especially small so that the bulk of the data processing occurs on the server. Although the term 'thin client' usually refers to software, it is increasingly used for computers, such as network computers and Net PCs, that are designed to serve as the clients for client/server architectures. Thin client is a low-cost, centrally-managed computer devoid of CD-ROM players, diskette drives, and expansion slots.
