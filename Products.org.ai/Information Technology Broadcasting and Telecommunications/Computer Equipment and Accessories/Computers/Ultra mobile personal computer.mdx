A hybrid device that is a cross between a PDA and Tablet computer. What makes the ultra mobile PC (UMPC) unique is that it relies on a full operating system like Windows or Linux instead of standard PDA operating systems like Palm and Pocket PC. The UMPC can be considered an additional tool for mobile computing instead of a PDA replacement. It was developed as a joint development exercise between Microsoft, Intel, and Samsung, among others.
