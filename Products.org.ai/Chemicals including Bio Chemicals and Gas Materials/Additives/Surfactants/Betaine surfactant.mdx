# Betaine surfactant

**UNSPSC Code**: 12161909
**Class**: [Surfactants](Surfactants.mdx)
**Family**: [Additives](../Additives.mdx)
**Segment**: [Chemicals including Bio Chemicals and Gas Materials](../../Chemicals including Bio Chemicals and Gas Materials.mdx)

Betaine surfactants as internally compensated quaternary ammonium compounds that differ from quaternary ammonium salts in that they do not have a mobile anion. Betaines retain their positive molecular charge and cationic character in both acidic and alkaline media.  Betaines are inherently mild to the skin and eyes. They also have strong anti-irritant properties when combined with anionic surfactants as shown later in this chapter. Betaines are not affected by water hardness and produce excellent foam with good stability in soft and hard water.
