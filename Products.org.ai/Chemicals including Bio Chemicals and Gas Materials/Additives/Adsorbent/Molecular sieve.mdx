# Molecular sieve

**UNSPSC Code**: 12165303
**Class**: [Adsorbent](Adsorbent.mdx)
**Family**: [Additives](../Additives.mdx)
**Segment**: [Chemicals including Bio Chemicals and Gas Materials](../../Chemicals including Bio Chemicals and Gas Materials.mdx)

A molecular sieve is a material with pores (very small holes) of uniform size. These pore diameters are similar in size to small molecules, and thus large molecules cannot enter or be adsorbed, while smaller molecules can.
