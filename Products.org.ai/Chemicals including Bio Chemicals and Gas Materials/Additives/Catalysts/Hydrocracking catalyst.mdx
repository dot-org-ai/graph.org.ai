Hydrocracking is a catalytic chemical process used in petroleum refineries for converting the high-boiling hydrocarbons in petroleum to low-boiling products such as gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel and diesel oil. HCU is converting the heavy, low value VGO into lighter, high value products (Naphta, Kerosene, Diesel) and is in most cases one of the moneymaker(s) in a refinery.
