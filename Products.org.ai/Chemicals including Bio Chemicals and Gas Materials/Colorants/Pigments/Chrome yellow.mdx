# Chrome yellow

**UNSPSC Code**: 12171620
**Class**: [Pigments](Pigments.mdx)
**Family**: [Colorants](../Colorants.mdx)
**Segment**: [Chemicals including Bio Chemicals and Gas Materials](../../Chemicals including Bio Chemicals and Gas Materials.mdx)

A natural yellow pigment made of lead chromate (PbCrO4). Because it tends to oxidize and darken on exposure to air over time, and contains lead, it has been largely replaced by Cadmium Yellow.
