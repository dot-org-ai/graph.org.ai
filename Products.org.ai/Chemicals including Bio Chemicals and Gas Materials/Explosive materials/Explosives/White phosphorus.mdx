# White phosphorus

**UNSPSC Code**: 12131510
**Class**: [Explosives](Explosives.mdx)
**Family**: [Explosive materials](../Explosive materials.mdx)
**Segment**: [Chemicals including Bio Chemicals and Gas Materials](../../Chemicals including Bio Chemicals and Gas Materials.mdx)

A material made from a common allotrope of the chemical element phosphorus that is used in smoke, tracer, illumination and incendiary munitions. White phosphorus is a translucent waxy solid that quickly becomes yellow when exposed to light. For this reason it is also called yellow phosphorus. It is highly flammable and pyrophoric (self-igniting) upon contact with air as well as toxic (causing severe liver damage on ingestion and phossy jaw from chronic ingestion or inhalation). The odour of combustion of this form has a characteristic garlic smell. White phosphorus is only slightly soluble in water and it can be stored under water. Indeed, white phosphorus is only safe from self-igniting when it is submerged in water. It is, however, soluble in benzene, oils, carbon disulfide, and disulfur dichloride
