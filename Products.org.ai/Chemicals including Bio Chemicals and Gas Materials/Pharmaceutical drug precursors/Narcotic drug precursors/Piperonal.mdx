An organic compound that is commonly found in fragrances and flavors. The molecule is structurally related to benzaldehyde and vanillin. It exists as a white or colorless solid. It has a floral odor commonly described as being similar to that of vanillin and cherry. It is used as flavoring and in perfumes.  Piperonal may be used in the synthesis of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine MDA via the substituted nitrostyrene via a condensation reaction.  This intermediate can then be reduced by a strong reducing agent such as lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4) to yield MDA.  However it can also be used in the illicit production of synthetic drugs like ecstasy and methamphetamine.
