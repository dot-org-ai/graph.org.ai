A phosphorus oxoacid and a powerful reducing agent with molecular formula H3PO2.  It is a colorless low-melting compound, which is soluble in water, dioxane, and alcohols and is used in the formulation of pharmaceuticals, discoloration of polymers, water treatment, retrieval of precious or non-ferrous metals. Its main use is for electroless plating.  Currently considered a controlled drug by the US Government because it can reduce elemental iodine to form hydroiodic acid, which is a reagent effective for reducing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine.
