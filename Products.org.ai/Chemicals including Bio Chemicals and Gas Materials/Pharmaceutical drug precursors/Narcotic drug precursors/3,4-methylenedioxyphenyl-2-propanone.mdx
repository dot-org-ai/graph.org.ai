**UNSPSC Code**: 12361502
**Class**: [Narcotic drug precursors](Narcotic drug precursors.mdx)
**Family**: [Pharmaceutical drug precursors](../Pharmaceutical drug precursors.mdx)
**Segment**: [Chemicals including Bio Chemicals and Gas Materials](../../Chemicals including Bio Chemicals and Gas Materials.mdx)

A chemical compound consisting of a phenylacetone moiety substituted with a methylenedioxy functional group. It is commonly synthesized from either safrole which, for comparison, is 3-[3,4-(methylenedioxy)phenyl]-2-propene) or its isomer isosafrole via oxidation using the Wacker oxidation or peroxyacid oxidation methods.  It is a controlled substance by the US Government on account of its relation to the MDxx chemical class, MDP2P, as well as safrole and isosafrole.
