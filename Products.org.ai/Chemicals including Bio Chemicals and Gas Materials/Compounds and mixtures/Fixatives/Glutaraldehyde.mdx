# Glutaraldehyde

**UNSPSC Code**: 12352502
**Class**: [Fixatives](Fixatives.mdx)
**Family**: [Compounds and mixtures](../Compounds and mixtures.mdx)
**Segment**: [Chemicals including Bio Chemicals and Gas Materials](../../Chemicals including Bio Chemicals and Gas Materials.mdx)

A chemical substance used in biochemistry applications as an amine-reactive homobifunctional crosslinker and fixative prior to SDS-PAGE, staining, or electron microscopy.  It kills cells quickly by crosslinking their proteins. It is usually employed alone or mixed with formaldehyde as the first of two fixative processes to stabilize specimens such as bacteria, plant material, and human cells.
