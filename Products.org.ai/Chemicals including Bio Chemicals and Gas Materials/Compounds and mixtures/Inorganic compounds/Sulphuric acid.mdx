A highly corrosive strong mineral acid with the molecular formula H2SO4. It is a pungent, colorless to slightly yellow viscous liquid which is soluble in water at all concentrations. It is widely produced with different methods, such as contact process, wet sulfuric acid process and some other methods. Sulfuric acid is produced from sulfur, oxygen and water via the conventional contact process (DCDA) or the wet sulfuric acid process (WSA). Most sulfuric acid production (60 percent) is consumed for fertilizers, particularly superphosphates, ammonium phosphate and ammonium sulfates. About 20 percent is used in chemical industry for production of detergents, synthetic resins, dyestuffs, pharmaceuticals, petroleum catalysts, insecticides and antifreeze, as well as in various processes such as oil well acidicizing, aluminium reduction, paper sizing, water treatment. About 6 percent of uses are related to pigments and include paints, enamels, printing inks, coated fabrics and paper, and the rest is dispersed into a multitude of applications such as production of explosives, cellophane, acetate and viscose textiles, lubricants, non-ferrous metals and batteries.
