# Molybdenum compound

**UNSPSC Code**: 12352328
**Class**: [Inorganic compounds](Inorganic compounds.mdx)
**Family**: [Compounds and mixtures](../Compounds and mixtures.mdx)
**Segment**: [Chemicals including Bio Chemicals and Gas Materials](../../Chemicals including Bio Chemicals and Gas Materials.mdx)

Molybdenum forms chemical compounds in oxidation states from -II to +VI. Higher oxidation states are more relevant to its terrestrial occurrence and its biological roles, mid-level oxidation states are often associated with metal clusters, and very low oxidation states are typically associated with organomolybdenum compounds.
