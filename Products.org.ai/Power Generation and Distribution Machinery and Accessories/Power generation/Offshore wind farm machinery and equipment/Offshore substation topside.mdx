# Offshore substation topside

**UNSPSC Code**: 26131908
**Class**: [Offshore wind farm machinery and equipment](Offshore wind farm machinery and equipment.mdx)
**Family**: [Power generation](../Power generation.mdx)
**Segment**: [Power Generation and Distribution Machinery and Accessories](../../Power Generation and Distribution Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

The offshore substations are used to reduce electrical losses before export of power to shore. This is done by increasing the voltage, and in some cases converting from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) The substation also contains equipment to manage the reactive power consumption of the electrical system including the capacitive effects of the export cables.
