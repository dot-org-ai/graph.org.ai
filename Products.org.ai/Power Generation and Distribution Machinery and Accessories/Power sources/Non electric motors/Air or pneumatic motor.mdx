# Air or pneumatic motor

**UNSPSC Code**: 26101301
**Class**: [Non electric motors](Non electric motors.mdx)
**Family**: [Power sources](../Power sources.mdx)
**Segment**: [Power Generation and Distribution Machinery and Accessories](../../Power Generation and Distribution Machinery and Accessories.mdx)

A type of motor which does mechanical work by expanding compressed air. Pneumatic motors generally convert the compressed air energy to mechanical work through either linear or rotary motion. Linear motion can come from either a diaphragm or piston actuator, while rotary motion is supplied by either a vane type air motor, piston air motor, air turbine or gear type motor.
