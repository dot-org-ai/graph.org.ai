A type of definite purpose motor developed to meet the specific needs of the vertical turbine pump industry. Employs a hollow shaft through which a pump shaft is extended. Adjustments to lift the impellers and give a running clearance for the pump casing can be made by turning a nut threaded on the shaft which is accessible at the top portion of the motor. Vertical turbine pump shafts are usually composed of many lengths joined by screw thread couplings.
