# Chemical Engineers

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 17-2041.00

Design chemical plant equipment and devise processes for manufacturing chemicals and products, such as gasoline, synthetic rubber, plastics, detergents, cement, paper, and pulp, by applying principles and technology of chemistry, physics, and engineering.

## Tasks

- [Troubleshoot problems with chemical manufacturing processes.](Tasks/18471.mdx)
- [Monitor and analyze data from processes and experiments.](Tasks/20955.mdx)
- [Evaluate chemical equipment and processes to identify ways to optimize performance or to ensure compliance with safety and environmental regulations.](Tasks/18472.mdx)
- [Design and plan layout of equipment.](Tasks/3560.mdx)
- [Prepare estimate of production costs and production progress reports for management.](Tasks/3554.mdx)
- [Perform tests and monitor performance of processes throughout stages of production to determine degree of control over variables such as temperature, density, specific gravity, and pressure.](Tasks/18473.mdx)
- [Conduct research to develop new and improved chemical manufacturing processes.](Tasks/3558.mdx)
- [Determine most effective arrangement of operations such as mixing, crushing, heat transfer, distillation, and drying.](Tasks/3553.mdx)
- [Develop processes to separate components of liquids or gases or generate electrical currents, using controlled chemical processes.](Tasks/3557.mdx)
