# Industrial Ecologists

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 19-2041.03

Apply principles and processes of natural ecosystems to develop models for efficient industrial systems. Use knowledge from the physical and social sciences to maximize effective use of natural resources in the production and use of goods and services. Examine societal issues and their relationship with both technical systems and the environment.

## Tasks

- [Identify environmental impacts caused by products, systems, or projects.](Tasks/19972.mdx)
- [Identify or develop strategies or methods to minimize the environmental impact of industrial production processes.](Tasks/16888.mdx)
- [Analyze changes designed to improve the environmental performance of complex systems and avoid unintended negative consequences.](Tasks/19965.mdx)
- [Conduct environmental sustainability assessments, using material flow analysis (MFA) or substance flow analysis (SFA) techniques.](Tasks/19968.mdx)
- [Identify sustainable alternatives to industrial or waste-management practices.](Tasks/19974.mdx)
- [Review research literature to maintain knowledge on topics related to industrial ecology, such as physical science, technology, economy, and public policy.](Tasks/19982.mdx)
- [Redesign linear, or open-loop, systems into cyclical, or closed-loop, systems so that waste products become inputs for new processes, modeling natural ecosystems.](Tasks/19980.mdx)
- [Prepare technical and research reports, such as environmental impact reports, and communicate the results to individuals in industry, government, or the general public.](Tasks/19978.mdx)
- [Examine local, regional, or global use and flow of materials or energy in industrial production processes.](Tasks/19970.mdx)
- [Monitor the environmental impact of development activities, pollution, or land degradation.](Tasks/16886.mdx)
