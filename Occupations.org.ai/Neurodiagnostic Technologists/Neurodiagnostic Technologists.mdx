# Neurodiagnostic Technologists

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 29-2099.01

Conduct electroneurodiagnostic (END) tests such as electroencephalograms, evoked potentials, polysomnograms, or electronystagmograms. May perform nerve conduction studies.

## Tasks

- [Indicate artifacts or interferences derived from sources outside of the brain, such as poor electrode contact or patient movement, on electroneurodiagnostic recordings.](Tasks/17429.mdx)
- [Monitor patients during tests or surgeries, using electroencephalographs (EEG), evoked potential (EP) instruments, or video recording equipment.](Tasks/17431.mdx)
- [Conduct tests or studies such as electroencephalography (EEG), polysomnography (PSG), nerve conduction studies (NCS), electromyography (EMG), and intraoperative monitoring (IOM).](Tasks/17425.mdx)
- [Collect patients' medical information needed to customize tests.](Tasks/17434.mdx)
- [Explain testing procedures to patients, answering questions or reassuring patients, as needed.](Tasks/17437.mdx)
- [Set up, program, or record montages or electrical combinations when testing peripheral nerve, spinal cord, subcortical, or cortical responses.](Tasks/17432.mdx)
- [Summarize technical data to assist physicians to diagnose brain, sleep, or nervous system disorders.](Tasks/17424.mdx)
- [Conduct tests to determine cerebral death, the absence of brain activity, or the probability of recovery from a coma.](Tasks/17427.mdx)
- [Attach electrodes to patients, using adhesives.](Tasks/17423.mdx)
- [Measure patients' body parts and mark locations where electrodes are to be placed.](Tasks/17430.mdx)
