# Computer Numerically Controlled Tool Operators

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 51-9161.00

Operate computer-controlled tools, machines, or robots to machine or process parts, tools, or other work pieces made of metal, plastic, wood, stone, or other materials. May also set up and maintain equipment.

## Tasks

- [Measure dimensions of finished workpieces to ensure conformance to specifications, using precision measuring instruments, templates, and fixtures.](Tasks/11932.mdx)
- [Set up and operate computer-controlled machines or robots to perform one or more machine functions on metal or plastic workpieces.](Tasks/11944.mdx)
- [Mount, install, align, and secure tools, attachments, fixtures, and workpieces on machines, using hand tools and precision measuring instruments.](Tasks/11934.mdx)
- [Review program specifications or blueprints to determine and set machine operations and sequencing, finished workpiece dimensions, or numerical control sequences.](Tasks/11946.mdx)
- [Stop machines to remove finished workpieces or to change tooling, setup, or workpiece placement, according to required machining sequences.](Tasks/11937.mdx)
- [Listen to machines during operation to detect sounds such as those made by dull cutting tools or excessive vibration, and adjust machines to compensate for problems.](Tasks/11935.mdx)
- [Implement changes to machine programs, and enter new specifications, using computers.](Tasks/11955.mdx)
- [Calculate machine speed and feed ratios and the size and position of cuts.](Tasks/11940.mdx)
- [Transfer commands from servers to computer numerical control (CNC) modules, using computer network links.](Tasks/11953.mdx)
- [Remove and replace dull cutting tools.](Tasks/11933.mdx)
