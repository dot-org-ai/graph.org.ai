# Microsystems Engineers

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 17-2199.06

Research, design, develop, or test microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices.

## Tasks

- [Create schematics and physical layouts of integrated microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) components or packaged assemblies consistent with process, functional, or package constraints.](Tasks/16503.mdx)
- [Investigate characteristics such as cost, performance, or process capability of potential microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) device designs, using simulation or modeling software.](Tasks/16497.mdx)
- [Create or maintain formal engineering documents, such as schematics, bills of materials, components or materials specifications, or packaging requirements.](Tasks/16492.mdx)
- [Conduct analyses addressing issues such as failure, reliability, or yield improvement.](Tasks/16505.mdx)
- [Plan or schedule engineering research or development projects involving microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology.](Tasks/16485.mdx)
- [Propose product designs involving microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology, considering market data or customer requirements.](Tasks/16495.mdx)
- [Develop formal documentation for microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices, including quality assurance guidance, quality control protocols, process control checklists, data collection, or reporting.](Tasks/16502.mdx)
- [Communicate operating characteristics or performance experience to other engineers or designers for training or new product development purposes.](Tasks/16490.mdx)
- [Evaluate materials, fabrication methods, joining methods, surface treatments, or packaging to ensure acceptable processing, performance, cost, sustainability, or availability.](Tasks/16498.mdx)
- [Refine final microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) design to optimize design for target dimensions, physical tolerances, or processing constraints.](Tasks/16494.mdx)
