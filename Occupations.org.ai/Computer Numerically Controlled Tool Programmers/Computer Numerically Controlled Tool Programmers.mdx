# Computer Numerically Controlled Tool Programmers

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 51-9162.00

Develop programs to control machining or processing of materials by automatic machine tools, equipment, or systems. May also set up, operate, or maintain equipment.

## Tasks

- [Determine the sequence of machine operations, and select the proper cutting tools needed to machine workpieces into the desired shapes.](Tasks/11959.mdx)
- [Analyze job orders, drawings, blueprints, specifications, printed circuit board pattern films, and design data to calculate dimensions, tool selection, machine speeds, and feed rates.](Tasks/11961.mdx)
- [Observe machines on trial runs or conduct computer simulations to ensure that programs and machinery will function properly and produce items that meet specifications.](Tasks/11963.mdx)
- [Write programs in the language of a machine's controller and store programs on media, such as punch tapes, magnetic tapes, or disks.](Tasks/11966.mdx)
- [Determine reference points, machine cutting paths, or hole locations, and compute angular and linear dimensions, radii, and curvatures.](Tasks/11962.mdx)
- [Enter computer commands to store or retrieve parts patterns, graphic displays, or programs that transfer data to other media.](Tasks/11968.mdx)
- [Revise programs or tapes to eliminate errors, and retest programs to check that problems have been solved.](Tasks/11960.mdx)
- [Modify existing programs to enhance efficiency.](Tasks/11967.mdx)
- [Enter coordinates of hole locations into program memories by depressing pedals or buttons of programmers.](Tasks/11965.mdx)
- [Sort shop orders into groups to maximize materials utilization and minimize machine setup time.](Tasks/11971.mdx)
