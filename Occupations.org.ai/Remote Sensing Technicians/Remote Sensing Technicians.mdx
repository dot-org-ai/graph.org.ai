# Remote Sensing Technicians

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 19-4099.03

Apply remote sensing technologies to assist scientists in areas such as natural resources, urban planning, or homeland security. May prepare flight plans or sensor configurations for flight trips.

## Tasks

- [Collect geospatial data, using technologies such as aerial photography, light and radio wave detection systems, digital satellites, or thermal energy systems.](Tasks/16999.mdx)
- [Verify integrity and accuracy of data contained in remote sensing image analysis systems.](Tasks/16986.mdx)
- [Integrate remotely sensed data with other geospatial data.](Tasks/16991.mdx)
- [Consult with remote sensing scientists, surveyors, cartographers, or engineers to determine project needs.](Tasks/16996.mdx)
- [Adjust remotely sensed images for optimum presentation by using software to select image displays, define image set categories, or choose processing routines.](Tasks/16997.mdx)
- [Manipulate raw data to enhance interpretation, either on the ground or during remote sensing flights.](Tasks/16998.mdx)
- [Merge scanned images or build photo mosaics of large areas, using image processing software.](Tasks/16990.mdx)
- [Participate in the planning or development of mapping projects.](Tasks/16981.mdx)
- [Prepare documentation or presentations, including charts, photos, or graphs.](Tasks/16987.mdx)
- [Correct raw data for errors due to factors such as skew or atmospheric variation.](Tasks/16994.mdx)
