- [Provide technical consultation or direction related to the development or production of fuel cell systems.](Tasks/16407.mdx)
- [Characterize component or fuel cell performances by generating operating maps, defining operating conditions, identifying design refinements, or executing durability assessments.](Tasks/16417.mdx)
- [Plan or implement fuel cell cost reduction or product improvement projects in collaboration with other engineers, suppliers, support personnel, or customers.](Tasks/19946.mdx)
- [Conduct fuel cell testing projects, using fuel cell test stations, analytical instruments, or electrochemical diagnostics, such as cyclic voltammetry or impedance spectroscopy.](Tasks/19950.mdx)
- [Analyze fuel cell or related test data, using statistical software.](Tasks/16419.mdx)
- [Conduct post-service or failure analyses, using electromechanical diagnostic principles or procedures.](Tasks/16414.mdx)
- [Define specifications for fuel cell materials.](Tasks/19951.mdx)
- [Recommend or implement changes to fuel cell system designs.](Tasks/16406.mdx)
