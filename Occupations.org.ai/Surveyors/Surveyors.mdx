# Surveyors

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 17-1022.00

Make exact measurements and determine property boundaries. Provide data relevant to the shape, contour, gravitation, location, elevation, or dimension of land or land features on or near the earth's surface for engineering, mapmaking, mining, land evaluation, construction, and other purposes.

## Tasks

- [Direct or conduct surveys to establish legal boundaries for properties, based on legal deeds and titles.](Tasks/3530.mdx)
- [Prepare and maintain sketches, maps, reports, and legal descriptions of surveys to describe, certify, and assume liability for work performed.](Tasks/3528.mdx)
- [Write descriptions of property boundary surveys for use in deeds, leases, or other legal documents.](Tasks/3534.mdx)
- [Verify the accuracy of survey data, including measurements and calculations conducted at survey sites.](Tasks/3529.mdx)
- [Search legal records, survey records, and land titles to obtain information about property boundaries in areas to be surveyed.](Tasks/3536.mdx)
- [Record the results of surveys, including the shape, contour, location, elevation, and dimensions of land or land features.](Tasks/3531.mdx)
- [Prepare, or supervise preparation of, all data, charts, plots, maps, records, and documents related to surveys.](Tasks/3533.mdx)
- [Compute geodetic measurements and interpret survey data to determine positions, shapes, and elevations of geomorphic and topographic features.](Tasks/3543.mdx)
- [Calculate heights, depths, relative positions, property lines, and other characteristics of terrain.](Tasks/3532.mdx)
- [Plan and conduct ground surveys designed to establish baselines, elevations, and other geodetic measurements.](Tasks/3535.mdx)
