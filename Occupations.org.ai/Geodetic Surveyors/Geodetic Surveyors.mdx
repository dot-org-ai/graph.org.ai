# Geodetic Surveyors

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 17-1022.01

Measure large areas of the Earth's surface using satellite observations, global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), light detection and ranging (LIDAR), or related sources.

## Tasks

- [Analyze control or survey data to ensure adherence to project specifications or land survey standards.](Tasks/16299.mdx)
- [Conduct surveys to determine exact positions, measurement of points, elevations, lines, areas, volumes, contours, or other features of land surfaces.](Tasks/16302.mdx)
- [Calculate the exact horizontal and vertical position of points on the Earth's surface.](Tasks/16298.mdx)
- [Maintain databases of geodetic and related information, including coordinate, descriptive, or quality assurance data.](Tasks/16295.mdx)
- [Verify the mathematical correctness of newly collected survey data.](Tasks/16292.mdx)
- [Compute horizontal and vertical coordinates of control networks, using direct leveling or other geodetic survey techniques, such as triangulation, trilateration, and traversing, to establish features of the Earth's surface.](Tasks/16297.mdx)
- [Plan or direct the work of geodetic surveying staff, providing technical consultation as needed.](Tasks/16289.mdx)
- [Assess the quality of control data to determine the need for additional survey data for engineering, construction, or other projects.](Tasks/16300.mdx)
- [Distribute compiled geodetic data to government agencies or the general public.](Tasks/16290.mdx)
- [Request additional survey data when field collection errors occur or engineering surveying specifications are not maintained.](Tasks/16293.mdx)
