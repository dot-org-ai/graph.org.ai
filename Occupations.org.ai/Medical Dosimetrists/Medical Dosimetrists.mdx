# Medical Dosimetrists

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 29-2036.00

Generate radiation treatment plans, develop radiation dose calculations, communicate and supervise the treatment plan implementation, and consult with members of radiation oncology team.

## Tasks

- [Design the arrangement of radiation fields to reduce exposure to critical patient structures, such as organs, using computers, manuals, and guides.](Tasks/22837.mdx)
- [Plan the use of beam modifying devices, such as compensators, shields, and wedge filters, to ensure safe and effective delivery of radiation treatment.](Tasks/22848.mdx)
- [Identify and outline bodily structures, using imaging procedures, such as x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or positron emission tomography.](Tasks/22844.mdx)
- [Calculate the delivery of radiation treatment, such as the amount or extent of radiation per session, based on the prescribed course of radiation therapy.](Tasks/22834.mdx)
- [Calculate, or verify calculations of, prescribed radiation doses.](Tasks/22833.mdx)
- [Develop radiation treatment plans in consultation with members of the radiation oncology team.](Tasks/22838.mdx)
- [Supervise or perform simulations for tumor localizations, using imaging methods such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or positron emission tomography scans.](Tasks/22850.mdx)
- [Create and transfer reference images and localization markers for treatment delivery, using image-guided radiation therapy.](Tasks/22836.mdx)
- [Record patient information, such as radiation doses administered, in patient records.](Tasks/22849.mdx)
