# Soil and Plant Scientists

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 19-1013.00

Conduct research in breeding, physiology, production, yield, and management of crops and agricultural plants or trees, shrubs, and nursery stock, their growth in soils, and control of pests; or study the chemical, physical, biological, and mineralogical composition of soils as they relate to plant or crop growth. May classify and map soils and investigate effects of alternative practices on soil and crop productivity.

## Tasks

- [Communicate research or project results to other professionals or the public or teach related courses, seminars, or workshops.](Tasks/9021.mdx)
- [Develop methods of conserving or managing soil that can be applied by farmers or forestry companies.](Tasks/9024.mdx)
- [Provide information or recommendations to farmers or other landowners regarding ways in which they can best use land, promote plant growth, or avoid or correct problems such as erosion.](Tasks/9022.mdx)
- [Conduct experiments to develop new or improved varieties of field crops, focusing on characteristics such as yield, quality, disease resistance, nutritional value, or adaptation to specific soils or climates.](Tasks/9025.mdx)
- [Investigate soil problems or poor water quality to determine sources and effects.](Tasks/9026.mdx)
- [Investigate responses of soils to specific management practices to determine the use capabilities of soils and the effects of alternative practices on soil productivity.](Tasks/9023.mdx)
- [Conduct experiments to investigate the underlying mechanisms of plant growth and response to the environment.](Tasks/23903.mdx)
- [Identify degraded or contaminated soils and develop plans to improve their chemical, biological, or physical characteristics.](Tasks/9030.mdx)
- [Develop new or improved methods or products for controlling or eliminating weeds, crop diseases, or insect pests.](Tasks/9035.mdx)
- [Provide advice regarding the development of regulatory standards for land reclamation or soil conservation.](Tasks/9034.mdx)
