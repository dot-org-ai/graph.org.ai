# Aerospace Engineers

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 17-2011.00

Perform engineering duties in designing, constructing, and testing aircraft, missiles, and spacecraft. May conduct basic and applied research to evaluate adaptability of materials and equipment to aircraft design and manufacture. May recommend improvements in testing equipment and techniques.

## Tasks

- [Formulate mathematical models or other methods of computer analysis to develop, evaluate, or modify design, according to customer engineering requirements.](Tasks/1339.mdx)
- [Plan or conduct experimental, environmental, operational, or stress tests on models or prototypes of aircraft or aerospace systems or equipment.](Tasks/1337.mdx)
- [Formulate conceptual design of aeronautical or aerospace products or systems to meet customer requirements or conform to environmental regulations.](Tasks/20724.mdx)
- [Plan or coordinate investigation and resolution of customers' reports of technical problems with aircraft or aerospace vehicles.](Tasks/1345.mdx)
- [Write technical reports or other documentation, such as handbooks or bulletins, for use by engineering staff, management, or customers.](Tasks/1340.mdx)
- [Direct or coordinate activities of engineering or technical personnel involved in designing, fabricating, modifying, or testing of aircraft or aerospace products.](Tasks/1335.mdx)
- [Evaluate product data or design from inspections or reports for conformance to engineering principles, customer requirements, environmental regulations, or quality standards.](Tasks/20725.mdx)
- [Develop design criteria for aeronautical or aerospace products or systems, including testing methods, production costs, quality standards, environmental standards, or completion dates.](Tasks/20726.mdx)
- [Analyze project requests, proposals, or engineering data to determine feasibility, productibility, cost, or production time of aerospace or aeronautical products.](Tasks/1341.mdx)
- [Maintain records of performance reports for future reference.](Tasks/1346.mdx)
