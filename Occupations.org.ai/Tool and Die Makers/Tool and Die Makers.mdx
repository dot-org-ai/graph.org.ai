# Tool and Die Makers

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 51-4111.00

Analyze specifications, lay out metal stock, set up and operate machine tools, and fit and assemble parts to make and repair dies, cutting tools, jigs, fixtures, gauges, and machinists' hand tools.

## Tasks

- [Verify dimensions, alignments, and clearances of finished parts for conformance to specifications, using measuring instruments such as calipers, gauge blocks, micrometers, or dial indicators.](Tasks/8490.mdx)
- [Set up and operate conventional or computer numerically controlled machine tools such as lathes, milling machines, or grinders to cut, bore, grind, or otherwise shape parts to prescribed dimensions and finishes.](Tasks/8492.mdx)
- [Visualize and compute dimensions, sizes, shapes, and tolerances of assemblies, based on specifications.](Tasks/8491.mdx)
- [Study blueprints, sketches, models, or specifications to plan sequences of operations for fabricating tools, dies, or assemblies.](Tasks/8489.mdx)
- [Fit and assemble parts to make, repair, or modify dies, jigs, gauges, and tools, using machine tools, hand tools, or welders.](Tasks/23938.mdx)
- [Inspect finished dies for smoothness, contour conformity, and defects.](Tasks/8496.mdx)
- [Select metals to be used from a range of metals and alloys, based on properties such as hardness or heat tolerance.](Tasks/8502.mdx)
- [Lift, position, and secure machined parts on surface plates or worktables, using hoists, vises, v-blocks, or angle plates.](Tasks/8498.mdx)
- [File, grind, shim, and adjust different parts to properly fit them together.](Tasks/8493.mdx)
- [Smooth and polish flat and contoured surfaces of parts or tools, using scrapers, abrasive stones, files, emery cloths, or power grinders.](Tasks/8497.mdx)
