# Fallers

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 45-4021.00

Use axes or chainsaws to fell trees using knowledge of tree characteristics and cutting techniques to control direction of fall and minimize tree damage.

## Tasks

- [Stop saw engines, pull cutting bars from cuts, and run to safety as tree falls.](Tasks/13484.mdx)
- [Appraise trees for certain characteristics, such as twist, rot, and heavy limb growth, and gauge amount and direction of lean, to determine how to control the direction of a tree's fall with the least damage.](Tasks/13485.mdx)
- [Saw back-cuts, leaving sufficient sound wood to control direction of fall.](Tasks/13486.mdx)
- [Clear brush from work areas and escape routes, and cut saplings and other trees from direction of falls, using axes, chainsaws, or bulldozers.](Tasks/13487.mdx)
- [Measure felled trees and cut them into specified log lengths, using chain saws and axes.](Tasks/13488.mdx)
- [Assess logs after cutting to ensure that the quality and length are correct.](Tasks/13489.mdx)
- [Determine position, direction, and depth of cuts to be made, and placement of wedges or jacks.](Tasks/13490.mdx)
- [Control the direction of a tree's fall by scoring cutting lines with axes, sawing undercuts along scored lines with chainsaws, knocking slabs from cuts with single-bit axes, and driving wedges.](Tasks/13491.mdx)
- [Trim off the tops and limbs of trees, using chainsaws, delimbers, or axes.](Tasks/13492.mdx)
- [Select trees to be cut down, assessing factors such as site, terrain, and weather conditions before beginning work.](Tasks/13493.mdx)
