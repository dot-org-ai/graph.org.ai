# Lathe and Turning Machine Tool Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 51-4034.00

Set up, operate, or tend lathe and turning machines to turn, bore, thread, form, or face metal or plastic materials, such as wire, rod, or bar stock.

## Tasks

- [Adjust machine controls and change tool settings to keep dimensions within specified tolerances.](Tasks/11993.mdx)
- [Move controls to set cutting speeds and depths and feed rates, and to position tools in relation to workpieces.](Tasks/11994.mdx)
- [Study blueprints, layouts or charts, and job orders for information on specifications and tooling instructions, and to determine material requirements and operational sequences.](Tasks/11992.mdx)
- [Inspect sample workpieces to verify conformance with specifications, using instruments such as gauges, micrometers, and dial indicators.](Tasks/11991.mdx)
- [Replace worn tools, and sharpen dull cutting tools and dies, using bench grinders or cutter-grinding machines.](Tasks/11999.mdx)
- [Move toolholders manually or by turning handwheels, or engage automatic feeding mechanisms to feed tools to and along workpieces.](Tasks/12003.mdx)
- [Compute unspecified dimensions and machine settings, using knowledge of metal properties and shop mathematics.](Tasks/12001.mdx)
- [Crank machines through cycles, stopping to adjust tool positions and machine controls to ensure specified timing, clearances, and tolerances.](Tasks/11997.mdx)
- [Position, secure, and align cutting tools in toolholders on machines, using hand tools, and verify their positions with measuring instruments.](Tasks/12000.mdx)
- [Start lathe or turning machines and observe operations to ensure that specifications are met.](Tasks/11995.mdx)
