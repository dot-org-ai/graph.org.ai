# Materials Scientists

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 19-2032.00

Research and study the structures and chemical properties of various natural and synthetic or composite materials, including metals, alloys, rubber, ceramics, semiconductors, polymers, and glass. Determine ways to strengthen or combine materials or develop new materials with new or specific properties for use in a variety of products and applications. Includes glass scientists, ceramic scientists, metallurgical scientists, and polymer scientists.

## Tasks

- [Conduct research on the structures and properties of materials, such as metals, alloys, polymers, and ceramics, to obtain information that could be used to develop new products or enhance existing ones.](Tasks/9087.mdx)
- [Test metals to determine conformance to specifications of mechanical strength, strength-weight ratio, ductility, magnetic and electrical properties, and resistance to abrasion, corrosion, heat, and cold.](Tasks/9098.mdx)
- [Test material samples for tolerance under tension, compression, and shear to determine the cause of metal failures.](Tasks/9097.mdx)
- [Determine ways to strengthen or combine materials or develop new materials with new or specific properties for use in a variety of products and applications.](Tasks/9090.mdx)
- [Prepare reports, manuscripts, proposals, and technical manuals for use by other scientists and requestors, such as sponsors and customers.](Tasks/20214.mdx)
- [Plan laboratory experiments to confirm feasibility of processes and techniques used in the production of materials with special characteristics.](Tasks/9085.mdx)
- [Recommend materials for reliable performance in various environments.](Tasks/9091.mdx)
- [Supervise and monitor production processes to ensure efficient use of equipment, timely changes to specifications, and project completion within time frame and budget.](Tasks/20215.mdx)
- [Research methods of processing, forming, and firing materials to develop such products as ceramic dental fillings, unbreakable dinner plates, and telescope lenses.](Tasks/9094.mdx)
- [Perform experiments and computer modeling to study the nature, structure, and physical and chemical properties of metals and their alloys, and their responses to applied forces.](Tasks/20213.mdx)
