# Geneticists

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 19-1029.03

Research and study the inheritance of traits at the molecular, organism or population level. May evaluate or treat patients with genetic disorders.

## Tasks

- [Supervise or direct the work of other geneticists, biologists, technicians, or biometricians working on genetics research projects.](Tasks/16828.mdx)
- [Plan or conduct basic genomic and biological research related to areas such as regulation of gene expression, protein interactions, metabolic networks, and nucleic acid or protein complexes.](Tasks/16839.mdx)
- [Prepare results of experimental findings for presentation at professional conferences or in scientific journals.](Tasks/16831.mdx)
- [Maintain laboratory notebooks that record research methods, procedures, and results.](Tasks/16832.mdx)
- [Write grants and papers or attend fundraising events to seek research funds.](Tasks/16817.mdx)
- [Search scientific literature to select and modify methods and procedures most appropriate for genetic research goals.](Tasks/16830.mdx)
- [Review, approve, or interpret genetic laboratory results.](Tasks/16829.mdx)
- [Attend clinical and research conferences and read scientific literature to keep abreast of technological advances and current genetic research findings.](Tasks/16827.mdx)
- [Evaluate genetic data by performing appropriate mathematical or statistical calculations and analyses.](Tasks/16834.mdx)
- [Analyze determinants responsible for specific inherited traits, and devise methods for altering traits or producing new traits.](Tasks/16840.mdx)
