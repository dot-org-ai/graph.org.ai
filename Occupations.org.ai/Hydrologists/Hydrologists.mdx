# Hydrologists

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 19-2043.00

Research the distribution, circulation, and physical properties of underground and surface waters; and study the form and intensity of precipitation and its rate of infiltration into the soil, movement through the earth, and return to the ocean and atmosphere.

## Tasks

- [Prepare written and oral reports describing research results, using illustrations, maps, appendices, and other information.](Tasks/18618.mdx)
- [Design and conduct scientific hydrogeological investigations to ensure that accurate and appropriate information is available for use in water resource management decisions.](Tasks/9104.mdx)
- [Measure and graph phenomena such as lake levels, stream flows, and changes in water volumes.](Tasks/9108.mdx)
- [Conduct research and communicate information to promote the conservation and preservation of water resources.](Tasks/9116.mdx)
- [Coordinate and supervise the work of professional and technical staff, including research assistants, technologists, and technicians.](Tasks/9102.mdx)
- [Study public water supply issues, including flood and drought risks, water quality, wastewater, and impacts on wetland habitats.](Tasks/9105.mdx)
- [Apply research findings to help minimize the environmental impacts of pollution, waterborne diseases, erosion, and sedimentation.](Tasks/9107.mdx)
- [Study and document quantities, distribution, disposition, and development of underground and surface waters.](Tasks/9100.mdx)
- [Install, maintain, and calibrate instruments such as those that monitor water levels, rainfall, and sediments.](Tasks/9112.mdx)
- [Develop computer models for hydrologic predictions.](Tasks/18617.mdx)
