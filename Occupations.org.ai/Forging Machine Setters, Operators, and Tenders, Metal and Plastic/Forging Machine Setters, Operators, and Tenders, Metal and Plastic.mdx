# Forging Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 51-4022.00

Set up, operate, or tend forging machines to taper, shape, or form metal or plastic parts.

## Tasks

- [Read work orders or blueprints to determine specified tolerances and sequences of operations for machine setup.](Tasks/10079.mdx)
- [Position and move metal wires or workpieces through a series of dies that compress and shape stock to form die impressions.](Tasks/10086.mdx)
- [Measure and inspect machined parts to ensure conformance to product specifications.](Tasks/10078.mdx)
- [Set up, operate, or tend presses and forging machines to perform hot or cold forging by flattening, straightening, bending, cutting, piercing, or other operations to taper, shape, or form metal.](Tasks/10085.mdx)
- [Turn handles or knobs to set pressures and depths of ram strokes and to synchronize machine operations.](Tasks/10082.mdx)
- [Install, adjust, and remove dies, synchronizing cams, forging hammers, and stop guides, using overhead cranes or other hoisting devices, and hand tools.](Tasks/10087.mdx)
- [Start machines to produce sample workpieces, and observe operations to detect machine malfunctions and to verify that machine setups conform to specifications.](Tasks/10080.mdx)
- [Confer with other workers about machine setups and operational specifications.](Tasks/10083.mdx)
- [Trim and compress finished forgings to specified tolerances.](Tasks/10089.mdx)
- [Remove dies from machines when production runs are finished.](Tasks/10081.mdx)
