# Cytogenetic Technologists

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 29-2011.01

Analyze chromosomes or chromosome segments found in biological specimens, such as amniotic fluids, bone marrow, solid tumors, and blood to aid in the study, diagnosis, classification, or treatment of inherited or acquired genetic diseases. Conduct analyses through classical cytogenetic, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) techniques.

## Tasks

- [Arrange and attach chromosomes in numbered pairs on karyotype charts, using standard genetics laboratory practices and nomenclature, to identify normal or abnormal chromosomes.](Tasks/17390.mdx)
- [Count numbers of chromosomes and identify the structural abnormalities by viewing culture slides through microscopes, light microscopes, or photomicroscopes.](Tasks/17389.mdx)
- [Examine chromosomes found in biological specimens to detect abnormalities.](Tasks/17385.mdx)
- [Apply prepared specimen and control to appropriate grid, run instrumentation, and produce analyzable results.](Tasks/20569.mdx)
- [Select appropriate culturing system or procedure based on specimen type and reason for referral.](Tasks/20565.mdx)
- [Analyze chromosomes found in biological specimens to aid diagnoses and treatments for genetic diseases such as congenital disabilities, fertility problems, and hematological disorders.](Tasks/17391.mdx)
- [Harvest cell cultures using substances such as mitotic arrestants, cell releasing agents, and cell fixatives.](Tasks/17382.mdx)
- [Summarize test results and report to appropriate authorities.](Tasks/17376.mdx)
- [Prepare biological specimens such as amniotic fluids, bone marrow, tumors, chorionic villi, and blood, for chromosome examinations.](Tasks/17388.mdx)
- [Select or prepare specimens and media for cell cultures using aseptic techniques, knowledge of medium components, or cell nutritional requirements.](Tasks/17377.mdx)
