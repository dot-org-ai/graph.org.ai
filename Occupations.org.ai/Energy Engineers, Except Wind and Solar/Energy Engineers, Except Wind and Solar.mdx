# Energy Engineers, Except Wind and Solar

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 17-2199.03

Design, develop, or evaluate energy-related projects or programs to reduce energy costs or improve energy efficiency during the designing, building, or remodeling stages of construction. May specialize in electrical systems; heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems; green buildings; lighting; air quality; or energy procurement.

## Tasks

- [Identify and recommend energy savings strategies to achieve more energy-efficient operation.](Tasks/20854.mdx)
- [Conduct energy audits to evaluate energy use and to identify conservation and cost reduction measures.](Tasks/20855.mdx)
- [Monitor and analyze energy consumption.](Tasks/18156.mdx)
- [Monitor energy related design or construction issues, such as energy engineering, energy management, or sustainable design.](Tasks/20856.mdx)
- [Inspect or monitor energy systems, including heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) or daylighting systems to determine energy use or potential energy savings.](Tasks/18150.mdx)
- [Advise clients or colleagues on topics such as climate control systems, energy modeling, data logging, sustainable design, or energy auditing.](Tasks/20857.mdx)
- [Analyze, interpret, or create graphical representations of energy data, using engineering software.](Tasks/18159.mdx)
- [Verify energy bills and meter readings.](Tasks/20858.mdx)
- [Collect data for energy conservation analyses, using jobsite observation, field inspections, or sub-metering.](Tasks/20859.mdx)
- [Manage the development, design, or construction of energy conservation projects to ensure acceptability of budgets and time lines, conformance to federal and state laws, or adherence to approved specifications.](Tasks/18151.mdx)
