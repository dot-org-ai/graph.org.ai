# Rolling Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 51-4023.00

Set up, operate, or tend machines to roll steel or plastic forming bends, beads, knurls, rolls, or plate, or to flatten, temper, or reduce gauge of material.

## Tasks

- [Monitor machine cycles and mill operation to detect jamming and to ensure that products conform to specifications.](Tasks/10092.mdx)
- [Adjust and correct machine set-ups to reduce thicknesses, reshape products, and eliminate product defects.](Tasks/10091.mdx)
- [Start operation of rolling and milling machines to flatten, temper, form, and reduce sheet metal sections and to produce steel strips.](Tasks/10096.mdx)
- [Examine, inspect, and measure raw materials and finished products to verify conformance to specifications.](Tasks/10093.mdx)
- [Read rolling orders, blueprints, and mill schedules to determine setup specifications, work sequences, product dimensions, and installation procedures.](Tasks/10094.mdx)
- [Manipulate controls and observe dial indicators to monitor, adjust, and regulate speeds of machine mechanisms.](Tasks/10095.mdx)
- [Set distance points between rolls, guides, meters, and stops, according to specifications.](Tasks/10097.mdx)
- [Calculate draft space and roll speed for each mill stand to plan rolling sequences and specified dimensions and tempers.](Tasks/10105.mdx)
- [Install equipment such as guides, guards, gears, cooling equipment, and rolls, using hand tools.](Tasks/10103.mdx)
- [Position, align, and secure arbors, spindles, coils, mandrels, dies, and slitting knives.](Tasks/10099.mdx)
