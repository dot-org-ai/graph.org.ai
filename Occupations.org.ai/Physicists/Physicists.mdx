# Physicists

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 19-2012.00

Conduct research into physical phenomena, develop theories on the basis of observation and experiments, and devise methods to apply physical laws and theories.

## Tasks

- [Perform complex calculations as part of the analysis and evaluation of data, using computers.](Tasks/10903.mdx)
- [Analyze data from research conducted to detect and measure physical phenomena.](Tasks/10905.mdx)
- [Describe and express observations and conclusions in mathematical terms.](Tasks/10904.mdx)
- [Design computer simulations to model physical data so that it can be better understood.](Tasks/10907.mdx)
- [Write research proposals to receive funding.](Tasks/21174.mdx)
- [Teach physics to students.](Tasks/10912.mdx)
- [Report experimental results by writing papers for scientific journals or by presenting information at scientific conferences.](Tasks/10906.mdx)
- [Observe the structure and properties of matter, and the transformation and propagation of energy, using equipment such as masers, lasers, and telescopes, to explore and identify the basic principles governing these phenomena.](Tasks/10910.mdx)
- [Develop theories and laws on the basis of observation and experiments, and apply these theories and laws to problems in areas such as nuclear energy, optics, and aerospace technology.](Tasks/10911.mdx)
- [Collaborate with other scientists in the design, development, and testing of experimental, industrial, or medical equipment, instrumentation, and procedures.](Tasks/10908.mdx)
