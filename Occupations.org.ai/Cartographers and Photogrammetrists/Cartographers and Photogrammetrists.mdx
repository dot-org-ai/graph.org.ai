# Cartographers and Photogrammetrists

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 17-1021.00

Research, study, and prepare maps and other spatial data in digital or graphic form for one or more purposes, such as legal, social, political, educational, and design purposes. May work with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). May design and evaluate algorithms, data structures, and user interfaces for GIS and mapping systems. May collect, analyze, and interpret geographic information provided by geodetic surveys, aerial photographs, and satellite data.

## Tasks

- [Compile data required for map preparation, including aerial photographs, survey notes, records, reports, and original maps.](Tasks/3517.mdx)
- [Delineate aerial photographic detail, such as control points, hydrography, topography, and cultural features, using precision stereoplotting apparatus or drafting instruments.](Tasks/3522.mdx)
- [Prepare and alter trace maps, charts, tables, detailed drawings, and three-dimensional optical models of terrain using stereoscopic plotting and computer graphics equipment.](Tasks/3524.mdx)
- [Study legal records to establish boundaries of local, national, and international properties.](Tasks/3526.mdx)
- [Inspect final compositions to ensure completeness and accuracy.](Tasks/3518.mdx)
- [Revise existing maps and charts, making all necessary corrections and adjustments.](Tasks/3516.mdx)
- [Identify, scale, and orient geodetic points, elevations, and other planimetric or topographic features, applying standard mathematical formulas.](Tasks/3514.mdx)
- [Collect information about specific features of the Earth, using aerial photography and other digital remote sensing techniques.](Tasks/3515.mdx)
- [Examine and analyze data from ground surveys, reports, aerial photographs, and satellite images to prepare topographic maps, aerial-photograph mosaics, and related charts.](Tasks/3520.mdx)
- [Build and update digital databases.](Tasks/3523.mdx)
