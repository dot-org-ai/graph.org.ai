# Heat Treating Equipment Setters, Operators, and Tenders, Metal and Plastic

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 51-4191.00

Set up, operate, or tend heating equipment, such as heat-treating furnaces, flame-hardening machines, induction machines, soaking pits, or vacuum equipment to temper, harden, anneal, or heat treat metal or plastic objects.

## Tasks

- [Read production schedules and work orders to determine processing sequences, furnace temperatures, and heat cycle requirements for objects to be heat-treated.](Tasks/12087.mdx)
- [Record times that parts are removed from furnaces to document that objects have attained specified temperatures for specified times.](Tasks/12088.mdx)
- [Adjust controls to maintain temperatures and heating times, using thermal instruments and charts, dials and gauges of furnaces, and color of stock in furnaces to make setting determinations.](Tasks/12094.mdx)
- [Start conveyors and open furnace doors to load stock, or signal crane operators to uncover soaking pits and lower ingots into them.](Tasks/12107.mdx)
- [Set up and operate or tend machines, such as furnaces, baths, flame-hardening machines, and electronic induction machines, that harden, anneal, and heat-treat metal.](Tasks/12089.mdx)
- [Remove parts from furnaces after specified times, and air dry or cool parts in water, oil brine, or other baths.](Tasks/12091.mdx)
- [Move controls to light gas burners and to adjust gas and water flow and flame temperature.](Tasks/12099.mdx)
- [Instruct new workers in machine operation.](Tasks/12093.mdx)
- [Determine flame temperatures, current frequencies, heating cycles, and induction heating coils needed, based on degree of hardness required and properties of stock to be treated.](Tasks/12095.mdx)
- [Determine types and temperatures of baths and quenching media needed to attain specified part hardness, toughness, and ductility, using heat-treating charts and knowledge of methods, equipment, and metals.](Tasks/12090.mdx)
