# Precision Agriculture Technicians

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 19-4012.01

Apply geospatial technologies, including geographic information systems (GIS) and Global Positioning System (GPS), to agricultural production or management activities, such as pest scouting, site-specific pesticide application, yield mapping, or variable-rate irrigation. May use computers to develop or analyze maps or remote sensing images to compare physical topography with data on soils, fertilizer, pests, or weather.

## Tasks

- [Document and maintain records of precision agriculture information.](Tasks/18295.mdx)
- [Collect information about soil or field attributes, yield data, or field boundaries, using field data recorders and basic geographic information systems (GIS).](Tasks/18281.mdx)
- [Use geospatial technology to develop soil sampling grids or identify sampling sites for testing characteristics such as nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium content, pH, or micronutrients.](Tasks/20872.mdx)
- [Divide agricultural fields into georeferenced zones, based on soil characteristics and production potentials.](Tasks/18284.mdx)
- [Install, calibrate, or maintain sensors, mechanical controls, GPS-based vehicle guidance systems, or computer settings.](Tasks/18280.mdx)
- [Create, layer, and analyze maps showing precision agricultural data, such as crop yields, soil characteristics, input applications, terrain, drainage patterns, or field management history.](Tasks/18289.mdx)
- [Compare crop yield maps with maps of soil test data, chemical application patterns, or other information to develop site-specific crop management plans.](Tasks/18279.mdx)
- [Analyze geospatial data to determine agricultural implications of factors such as soil quality, terrain, field productivity, fertilizers, or weather conditions.](Tasks/20875.mdx)
- [Identify spatial coordinates, using remote sensing and Global Positioning System (GPS) data.](Tasks/18282.mdx)
- [Analyze data from harvester monitors to develop yield maps.](Tasks/20874.mdx)
