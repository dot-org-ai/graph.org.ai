# Microbiologists

**O*NET-SOC Code**: 19-1022.00

Investigate the growth, structure, development, and other characteristics of microscopic organisms, such as bacteria, algae, or fungi. Includes medical microbiologists who study the relationship between organisms and disease or the effects of antibiotics on microorganisms.

## Tasks

- [Isolate and maintain cultures of bacteria or other microorganisms in prescribed or developed media, controlling moisture, aeration, temperature, and nutrition.](Tasks/15212.mdx)
- [Provide laboratory services for health departments, community environmental health programs, and physicians needing information for diagnosis and treatment.](Tasks/3676.mdx)
- [Monitor and perform tests on water, food, and the environment to detect harmful microorganisms or to obtain information about sources of pollution, contamination, or infection.](Tasks/15213.mdx)
- [Examine physiological, morphological, and cultural characteristics, using microscope, to identify and classify microorganisms in human, water, and food specimens.](Tasks/3675.mdx)
- [Supervise biological technologists and technicians and other scientists.](Tasks/3679.mdx)
- [Use a variety of specialized equipment, such as electron microscopes, gas and high-pressure liquid chromatographs, electrophoresis units, thermocyclers, fluorescence-activated cell sorters, and phosphorimagers.](Tasks/3683.mdx)
- [Investigate the relationship between organisms and disease, including the control of epidemics and the effects of antibiotics on microorganisms.](Tasks/3678.mdx)
- [Prepare technical reports and recommendations, based upon research outcomes.](Tasks/3681.mdx)
- [Observe action of microorganisms upon living tissues of plants, higher animals, and other microorganisms, and on dead organic matter.](Tasks/3677.mdx)
- [Study growth, structure, development, and general characteristics of bacteria and other microorganisms to understand their relationship to human, plant, and animal health.](Tasks/3680.mdx)
